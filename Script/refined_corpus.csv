56841622100; 57194065494,The Resource Curse in the Gulf Region: Charting a Path for Long-term Economic Sustainability,2024,"The economies of the Gulf states have been reliant on abundant petroleum resources for over a century. The region has experienced substantial economic success in recent decades, attributed to its competitive advantage as the world’s oil empire. This success is especially noteworthy given that oil is a major economic resource in the area. However, a new debate has emerged, focusing on the concept of the resource curse resulting from the overdependence of Gulf economies on the petrol dollar. This reliance jeopardizes the long-term and future economic sustainability of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. This piece employs a narrative literature review to illustrate how petroleum has shaped the economic landscape, and also the oil market volatility on the economic landscape of the region. The review emphasizes on the necessity for the region to shift its economic and institutional over-dependence away from the petrol dollar to other sustainable alternative economic domains. The review proposes strategic economic directions to guide the region towards a diversified and sustainable economic portfolio, reflecting significant potential for the economy of the region and its states. Sustainable economic development portfolios such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, smart cities, real estate development, sports, banking, tourism, and travel were analyzed. © 2024, Econjournals.

However, no studies have given rigorous empirical evidence on the development of tourism under the construction of smart cities. Based on the panel data of 297 cities from 2000 to 2021, this paper uses three batches of smart city designations in China as quasi-natural experiments and constructs a time-varying difference-in-difference (DID) model to empirically test the tourism economic effects of smart city construction. It is found that smart city designation significantly increases urban tourism revenue by 24.3% and tourist arrivals by 17.2%. After the parallel trend test, the results of the dynamic DID model reveal the increasing tourism economic effect as the smart city construction progresses. Moreover, the potential Selection Bias and the specificity of the four municipalities in the model are taken into account, and false designated cities are randomly generated as placebos. A series of robustness tests enhance the credibility of the findings. Combined with the availability of data, this study verifies four main impact mechanisms, including attracting tourism investment, stimulating tourism entrepreneurial activities, improving tourism operational efficiency, and attracting relevant talents to work in tourism. Considering that the growth of smart economy may break the spatial barrier, we combine the spatial Durbin model with the DID model. The results based on the three spatial weight matrices all support the existence of spatial spillover tourism economic effects of the smart city construction. This study has implications for other countries with plans to upgrade urban construction patterns and transform traditional tourism. © The Author(s) 2024.",,English,Article,259,11,Rural Resource Management

Through the case study of Xiamen, based on smart card data, this paper divides the obtained origin-destination data into local and global levels with trip cutoff thresholds. The distribution of city centers is analyzed by detecting the overall urban space community structure and the two-level intraisland and cross-island urban space community structure with the PageRank and community detection algorithms. The results revealed that: (1) in the spatial structure of the island-oriented city, the cores are clustered on the island, while the centers are distributed in bands and dots outside the island; (2) the community units are distributed across the island; and (3) the space community boundary of the island-oriented city is quite different from the artificially defined administrative unit boundary. To summarize, by enhancing the delineation of urban spatial communities using the Gaussian kernel function and least-squares cross-validation, improving the model granularity, and integrating data from multiple public transport modes, this paper achieved a more precise division of urban spatial community structures. Consequently, it revealed the distinctive urban form and developmental pattern of the island-oriented city, holding significant implications for investigating urban spatial layout studies. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.","China; Fujian; Xiamen; Basic units; Community detection; Community IS; Community structures; Island-oriented city; Smart card data; Space community; Trip cutoff threshold; Urban space structures; Urban spaces; bus transport; public transport; urban area; urban development, Community detection; Island-oriented city; Smart card data (SCD); Trip cutoff threshold; Urban space structure",English,Article,235,3,Urban Sustainability
57217826346,Can digital economy improve tourism economic resilience? Evidence from China,2024,"The digital economy has become an important driver of resilient growth in tourism economy. Taking China as the research object, it is found that the digital economy not only has a positive spatial spillover effect on tourism economic resilience but also mitigates the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The heterogeneity test shows that the digital economy has a spatial diffusion effect on tourism economic resilience in the eastern, western, and southern regions and a spatial siphoning effect on the non-pilot areas of the National Smart Tourism Pilot Policy. The result of influence mechanism test proves that the digital economy can contribute to the tourism economic resilience by stimulating tourism fiscal expenditure, guiding tourism industry cluster, and increasing tourism consumption.

7201966448; 7404491150,Urban walkability and tour bus travel,2024,"Urban walkability is receiving increasing research attention due to the environmental and health benefits of walking in comparison to driving, yet little is known regarding the walking behaviors of urban visitors who arrive by tour bus. The purpose of this study is to investigate the walking behaviors of diverse tour bus user groups visiting a spatially complex urban destination to better understand urban walkability, barriers to walking, and the derived benefits to walking for tour bus participants. Using an immersive mixed-methods approach, researchers collected eight days of on-bus/off-bus data to document information specific to walking activities, site-to-site transport, tour bus cruising/idling, operational efficiency, mobility, access, and safety. Four target visitor groups included school age, adults, international, and senior citizen veterans. Pedestrian miles traveled ranged from 2.0 to 10.5 miles during tours that lasted between 4.30 and 14.15 h, while primary barriers to walking included itineraries, weather, and safety considerations. Addressing the psychology of walking to evolve from utilitarian to a purposefully integrated leisure activity within tour bus itineraries is the key to decreasing dependency on tour buses for site-to-site transport in urban destinations. Management implications: • Spatially complex urban park designs should consider walkability factors such as access, connectivity, path quality, safety, and aesthetics.•Policies that highlight and reward smart mobility should be prioritized to increase utilitarian and leisure walking in urban parks.•Tour mode bundles should purposefully embed walking activities in itineraries to increase physical benefits and participant satisfaction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",", Constraints; Tour bus travel; Urban parks; Walkability; Walking benefits",English,Article,242,4,Mobility and Transportation

This increase in environmental awareness has led destinations to prioritize green practices that reduce environmental pollution. Moreover, in recent years, with the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence technology has also been used in applications that reduce environmental pollution in destinations. This is because environmentally friendly products and services offered by destinations have started to have an impact on tourists' travel choices. Additionally, tourists' awareness and loyalty towards environmentally friendly destinations have started to increase, resulting in the formation of brand value for destinations. Therefore, green practices and AI technologies play a role in the formation of consumer-based destination green brand value. © 2024 Alhamzah Alnoor, Gül Erkol Bayram, Chew XinYing and Syed Haider Ali Shah.

These approaches can predict macroscopic species distribution patterns and trends that can inform preventive measures to avoid the loss of ecosystem functions and services. They can, therefore, help study and mitigate climate change implications on biodiversity conservation in fragile ecosystems. Wetlands are particularly fragile ecosystems where climate change poses severe risks and has dramatically reduced their size over the past century, with profound consequences on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Through big-data mining approaches, we can predict future wetland biodiversity trends in the context of climate change. This paper proposes such predictive analysis for a specific wetland: The Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy. This basin is a critical tourist attraction due to its rich biodiversity, making it an area of interest for citizens, tourists, and scientists. However, the region's suitability for native and non-native species is at risk due to climate and land-use change. Using machine-learning models, we predict the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in the basin under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The results suggest that habitat suitability has generally improved from 1950 to today, presumably owing to the targeted conservation strategies adopted in the area, but climate change will severely reduce bird biodiversity by 2050 while favouring several insect species' proliferation and other species' habitat change, even under a medium-emission scenario. This will lead to significant changes in the basin's biodiversity. Our methodology is adaptable to other wetland basins, being fully based on open data and models. The spatially explicit modelling used in this research provides valuable information for policymakers and spatial planners, complementing traditional biodiversity trend analyses. © 2024 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Ecological niche modelling; Maximum entropy; Open Science; Species richness; Wetlands, Italy; Lake Massaciuccoli; Lucca; Tuscany; artificial intelligence; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; ecological modeling; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; greenhouse gas; maximum entropy analysis; spatial distribution; species richness; tourist attraction; wetland",English,Article,285,11,Rural Resource Management

A complex artificial neural network model was built to predict the incoming tourism flow in the Apulia region of Southern Italy as a function of the heterogeneity of the tourism supply available in this area. Open data from the Regional Tourism Observatory were targeted. Information on the distribution of facilities and activities that attract regional tourist flows was collected and grouped by municipality. An artificial neural network model was built with total tourist attendance as the dependent variable and tourist attractions as regressors. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to select the optimal model using the lowest value. The final model was run with a hidden layer consisting of three neurons and a decay value of 0.01. A Multi-Objective Counterfactual model (MOC) was then constructed using a randomly selected row of normalized data frame to validate a useful tool in increasing total tourist attendance by 20% over that of the randomly selected municipality. A Garson’s variables importance plot indicated natural landscapes such as beaches, sea caves, and natural parks have a primary role expressed in terms of variable importance in the AI algorithm when used as an innovative methodology for evaluating tourism flows in the Apulia region. A further MOC model built using a randomly selected row of normalized data frame showed convents, libraries, historical buildings, public gardens, and museums as the top five features most modified to improve total attendance in a randomly selected municipality. Use of AI modeling revealed that the implementation of nature-based solutions may speed up the flow of tourism in the Apulia region while also promoting sustainable social development. © 2024 by the authors.","Apulia; counterfactual analysis; global health; Italy; machine learning; neural network analysis; sustainable climate action; tourism, Italy; Puglia; artificial neural network; error analysis; historic building; museum; network analysis; sustainability; tourism management; tourist attraction",English,Article,278,3,Urban Sustainability

At present, the spatial differentiation and driving mechanism of rural spatial poverty risk in Tibet are not clear, which adversely affects the formulation of differentiated and precise governance strategies. Thus, based on the social–ecological system perspective, 967 poor rural villages in eastern Tibet were taken as an example, using intelligent techniques such as random forest, geographic detector, and multi-scale geographically weighted regression to identify the spatial differentiation characteristics and the driving mechanism of poverty. The results indicated that (1) the high poverty incidence of rural areas in eastern Tibet showed a scattered block distribution, of which approximately 37% of the villages presented a spatial distribution characterised by a high degree of clustering of the high poverty incidence. (2) Topography and the level of public facilities were key factors influencing the poverty levels of rural areas in eastern Tibet, in which the coupling explanatory power between the construction land slope index (CLSI) and several poverty-causing factors was high. (3) Geological disaster, land surface temperature, CLSI, traffic accessibility, livestock resources, cropland per capita, and tourism resources differentially drove the poverty incidence of rural areas in eastern Tibet, forming spatial partitions dominated by the risks of potential, marginal, and recurrent poverty. For different partitions, differentiated governance strategies of upgrading ecological environments, optimising geographical locations, and revitalising social resources were proposed to provide references for solving the problem of relative poverty in the new period. © 2024 by the authors.","China; Xizang; agricultural production; differentiation; livestock; poverty alleviation; rural transport; spatial distribution; surface temperature; topography; tourism; village, driving mechanism; eastern Tibet; multi-scale geographically weighted regression; random forest; rural poverty; social–ecological systems; spatial differentiation",English,Article,268,11,Rural Resource Management

Based on resilience theory, the impacts of major public health events on tourist attractions and the relationship between the impacts and the development resilience of the tourist attractions, this study uses the composite index method and DEMATEL method to construct an index system for evaluating the development resilience of tourist attractions. This evaluation index includes 20 indicators in the four dimensions of prevention ability, resistance ability, recovery ability and renewal ability, and the weight of each indicator was de-termined. The results show three important aspects of tourist attraction resilience. (1) Resistance ability is the most important dimension that reflects the resilience level of tourist attractions, followed by renewal ability and recovery ability, while prevention ability is relatively less important. (2) Tourism revenue reconstruction, mechanism innova-tion, marketing flexibility and financing ability have large positive correlations with the resilience level of tourist at-tractions. (3) Market flexibility, management decision-making level, financing ability and intelligent construction level are susceptible to other indicators, so that more attention should be paid to them in the process of improving the resilience level of tourist attractions. The index system developed in this study can provide scientifically valid guidance and a useful reference for tourist attractions to accurately examine their own issues and improve their development resilience. © 2024, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

It is a guiding concept for building a world in which present and future generations may flourish. In the present era all the sectors are shifting towards sustainable development, including the tourism sector, which is another significant contributor towards country's economic development. This chapter deals with power generation using renewable energy for sustainability in tourist resorts and hotels. The adaptation of green energy or renewable energy by the government, businesses, and individuals is increasing for the transition to a more sustainable environment. This chapter is focused on the world heritage site 'Nalanda', located near Rajgir, in the state of Bihar, which is a tourist destination and attracts a large number of tourists. Thus being a tourist destination, the hotels and resorts located nearby must adopt sustainable practices. Nowadays many tourists prefer those hotels and resorts that offer them a sustainable living. Bihar is a region with small hills, including the Rajgir hills in the centre, the Kaimur Range in the southwest, and the Shivalik Range in the north, which makes it suitable for wind turbine set up and the abundant availability of sunlight throughout the year makes it ideal for setting up of PV. A power plant is being developed in a village called Kulin the Nalanda district, using HOMER Pro software taking wind and solar as the sources for generation of electricity which can be supplied there through grid to the resorts and hotels. © 2024, IGI Global.

This study proposes a measurement system for the digital economy from the perspective of digital infrastructure, integrated industrial development and the environment on the basis of Chinese city-level data from 2011 to 2018. First, the empirical discussion indicates that the digital economy can accelerate the recovery of the tourism and travel market at a faster pace. Additionally, it can have an indirect effect on tourism development by influencing the employment structure, economic growth, the innovation level and educational progress. Furthermore, spatial econometric analysis reveals that tourism development exhibits spatial autocorrelation and spatial agglomeration. The influence of the digital economy shows a strong negative spatial spillover effect, which diminishes as the geographical threshold value increases. In addition, a difference-in-differences (DID) model and a spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) model derived from the “Broadband China” policy are used to establish causality between the digital economy and tourism. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.","China; digitization; empirical analysis; industrial development; integrated approach; numerical model; spillover effect; tourism development, Digital economy; IV estimation; Spatial difference-in-differences model; Spatial Durbin model; Tourism development",English,Article,190,11,Rural Resource Management

The present study takes into account the top 10 most visited nations by tourists to examine the impact of fossil fuel energy consumption, technological innovation, foreign direct investment (FDI), economic growth, and globalization on tourism inflows from 2008 to 2022. Choice of appropriate technique for empirical testing is based on the PP-Fisher, ADF Fisher, IPS, and LLC unit root tests. Due to mixed order of integration of variables, the Panel ARDL is more reliable for econometric investigation. The findings of Panel ARDL reveal that the most significant contributing factors towards growth in tourism are technological innovation, the globalization index, growth in gross domestic product, and use of fossil fuels as an energy source. These results imply that advancements in technology, increased globalization trends, and economic growth are facilitating the growth in tourism activities. Likewise, non-renewable energy consumption is significantly linked to tourism growth in these countries which exhibits that these governments are relying upon fossil fuel consumption to meet the energy demand for tourism activities and to fuel economic growth. Though, FDI is having a detrimental effect on tourism inflows in the top 10 most frequently visited nations. This outcome entails that expanded industrialization and economic footprint negatively influence the ecological environment which adversely affects tourism inflows. The policy implications of this research assert that the development of clean and renewable energy technologies is essential for the promotion of sustainable economic growth, promote eco-tourism in these countries. Similarly, smart manufacturing and environment friendly production can alleviate the negative effects of ecological footprint on tourism inflows. © 2024, Econjournals.

Previous studies have proposed reasonable models and efficient algorithms for optimizing public bicycle scheduling, but there is still a lack of consideration for actual road network distances between stations and the temporal characteristics of demand at rental points in the model construction process. Therefore, this paper aims to construct a public bicycle dispatch framework based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of borrowing and returning demands. Firstly, the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of borrowing and returning demands for public bicycles are explored, the origin–destination (OD) correlation coefficients are defined, and the intensity of connections between rental point areas is analyzed. Secondly, based on the temporal characteristics of rental point demands, a random forest prediction model is constructed with weather factors, time characteristics, and rental point locations as feature variables, and station bicycle-borrowing and -returning demands as the target variable. Finally, bicycle dispatch regions are delineated based on actual path distances between stations and OD correlation coefficients, and a public bicycle regional dispatch optimization method is established. Taking the PBS in Ningbo City as an example, the balancing optimization framework proposed in this paper is validated. The results show that the regional dispatch optimization method proposed in this paper can achieve optimized dispatch of public bicycles during peak hours. Additionally, compared with the Taboo search algorithm (TSA), the genetic algorithm (GA) exhibits a 11.1% reduction in rebalancing time and a 40.4% reduction in trip cost. © 2024 by the authors.","China; Ningbo; Zhejiang; detection method; genetic algorithm; optimization; public transport; spatiotemporal analysis, demand prediction; dispatch optimization; public bicycle; public transportation; spatiotemporal characteristics",English,Article,278,4,Mobility and Transportation

Although they can be determined by traditional approaches (e.g., surveys, ride-check counts, and/or smartcard-based methods), the availability of new technologies and the proliferation of portable devices triggers an emerging interest in building OD matrices from the apps of bus operators. This research proposes the first framework for the estimation of OD matrices on transit networks by processing smartphone app call detail records (SACDRs). The framework is experimentally tested on a sample of 30 workdays of an Italian bus operator. The results are represented by easy-to-read control dashboards based on maps, which help quantify and visualise the OD matrices in the metropolitan area of Cagliari (Italy). The experimentation shows that the framework can properly estimate the number of trips for both origin and destination w.r.t.

This study analyzes the effects of tourism agglomeration on agricultural carbon intensity across 30 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2020. It is framed within the context of rural digitalization, with a particular emphasis on the integration of agro-tourism and the total factor productivity of agriculture. Utilizing spatial econometric models, we find that tourism agglomeration hinders the low-carbon transition in agriculture by influencing carbon intensity both directly and indirectly. At the national level, the impact of tourism agglomeration follows an inverted-U curve with respect to agro-tourism integration and carbon intensity. At the regional level, the effects vary, with weaker indirect influences in major grain-producing areas. Furthermore, rural digitalization appears to lessen the adverse impacts of tourism on carbon intensity. This study also identifies significant spatial spillover effects from tourism agglomeration. The findings suggest that provinces with high tourist influx should enhance investments in climate-smart agricultural practices and technologies to counteract these negative impacts. Moreover, integrated governance of tourism and agriculture is essential for achieving carbon neutrality in both sectors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural carbon intensity; Agro-tourism integration; Location quotient; Total factor productivity; Tourism agglomeration, Agriculture; Carbon; China; Tourism; Agriculture; Carbon; Integration; Rural areas; carbon; Agricultural carbon intensity; Agro-tourism integration; Carbon intensity; Location quotients; Low carbon agricultures; Low-carbon transitions; National level; Spatial econometric models; Total factor productivity; Tourism agglomeration; agglomeration; econometrics; governance approach; integrated approach; total factor productivity; agriculture; Article; autocorrelation; carbon emission; China; climate; econometric model; economic development; energy yield; investment; production efficiency; productivity; quantitative analysis; rural area; Shannon index; tourism; Agglomeration",English,Article,196,11,Rural Resource Management

Destination brand positioning offers a solution, yet techniques leveraging social media data for strategic positioning remain scarce. This research introduces a method, using Flickr photos, to: (a) identify the key features that define the brand identity of Thailand's national parks, (b) develop a categorical framework to group these parks based on their features and (c) uncover the distinctive features that differentiate parks within each identified category. Utilising Google Cloud Vision AI and LDA topic modelling, 51,387 photos across 125 parks were analysed, revealing 11 topics. K-Means clustering, supplemented by an innovative associative word analysis, discerned five park categories, and the distinctive features of each park. The findings advocate for Thai national parks to adopt strategies including brand positioning, repositioning, demarketing, and collaborative branding to harmoniously bridge sustainability and market demands. Management Implications: • Association analysis can serve as an important tool for DMOs and conservation agencies to better understand and manage points of difference in nature-based tourism destinations. • The results of association analysis can inform brand positioning, repositioning, demarketing, and collaborative branding strategies that balance market needs with sustainability. • Distinctive brand positioning can be used to promote lesser-known destinations. Repositioning can be used to promote other strategic images and attributes of the destination. E.g., Khao Khitchakut National Park, which is famous for “Buddha footprint” can promote outstanding natural trails and wildlife that could attract high-value tourists. Demarketing may be necessary to conserve the uniqueness of certain destinations. We show some examples with overtourism that are put under great concern and should rely on carrying capacity strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",", Brand positioning; Flickr; National parks; Sustainability; Topic modelling",English,Article,276,3,Urban Sustainability

Consequently, this paper aims to evaluate and compare the commitment of citizens, as tourists, from the 27 member states of the European Union to sustainable tourism. A map of sustainability was developed through the use of machine learning algorithms. A cluster analysis was performed, followed by a sustainable rating. The main findings indicate the existence of three country segments among the European Union member states according to the involvement of its citizens as tourists with sustainable practices: highly committed, moderately committed, and uncommitted. Based on these segments, we proposed a recommendation system that suggests the top-five countries where tourists could exchange sustainable tourism habits based on the idea of contagion or imitation behaviours among individuals across an extensive set of everyday decisions. The results reveal significant variations in sustainable tourism practices across member states, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for harmonisation. By implementing this recommendation system, we facilitate the adoption of sustainable habits among tourists and stakeholders, driving a more unified approach to sustainability in the multiple tourism destinations. This study shows no convergence between the 27 European Union member states regarding sustainable tourism. Therefore, political policies are necessary so that all citizens converge on sustainable tourist habits and the European Union contributes, as a whole, to sustainable tourism. © 2024 by the authors.",", clustering; machine learning; recommendation systems; sustainability information availability; sustainable tourism; tourists’ sustainable behaviours",English,Article,245,11,Rural Resource Management

Yet, overzealous and recurrent observations may exert undue stress on marine creatures, thereby complicating the sustainable management of marine assets. After the easing of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, a notable influx of tourists to Little Liuqiu Island, Taiwan puts considerable stress on its green sea turtle population. This surge intensified incidents of illegal harassment, triggering concerns from both the local community and administrative bodies. The prevailing challenge is to ensure tourists observe these turtles with respect, refraining from behaviors such as touching or pursuing them. Addressing this, our study harnesses deep learning algorithms to equip ecotourism operators and tourists with tools to detect green sea turtles across diverse coastal terrains, reinforcing conservation efforts. Our analysis scrutinized object detection AI models, namely YOLOv3, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5l. Fieldwork was undertaken on the island to gather ample training images, capturing elusive green sea turtles in various settings, from coastline strolls to drone imagery. Supplemental images sourced from local social media platforms were later added. Contrary to expectations, we found that merely expanding the training dataset did not guarantee improved outcomes. Instead, the variance in image content, considering distances, angles, and turtle appearances, played a pivotal role in enhancing model precision. Through our experimentation, the streamlined YOLOv5s model consistently eclipsed its more complex counterparts in performance. An AI service, underpinned by the YOLOv5s model, has been launched to distinguish between green sea turtle types for tourist-focused conservation initiatives. Future iterations will incorporate user feedback to refine accuracy.

However, safety is the most severe issue facing cyclists and the essential factor for people who are hesitant to use bikes. In this context, we propose a safety assessment method for cycling routes in urban environments. This work presents how to automatically generate a safe cycling map integrating volunteered geographic information with GIS analysis. We start by extracting the indicators that can possibly contribute to cycling safety from OpenStreetMap. Then, we set up a multivariate linear regression equation to solve the importance of indicators. Afterward, we generate a weighted graph model that represents cycling safety. Taking the City of Bonn, Germany, as an example, we implement our approach for this region. The experiment results show that Bonn is a city for safe cycling, confirming the claim that Bonn is a bike-friendly city. Our findings can also be used to plan the safest route for cycling, thereby enhancing the overall biking experience in Bonn. © Author(s) 2024.

In the water cycle, carbon is released during wastewater discharge, wastewater treatment, and subsequent changes in aquatic ecosystems. To gain a comprehensive understanding of this entire process, we investigate the intricate connections using balanced panel data from 261 prefecture-level cities in China spanning the period from 2000 to 2020. Each sample is quantified using 48 features derived from hydrosphere, biosphere, anthroposphere, atmosphere, pedosphere and lithosphere. This paper contributes to the relevant studies in the following ways: Firstly, to analyze the basic interaction within the water cycle, we utilize Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Our results indicate a weak linear relationship between wastewater treatment and carbon emissions. We also substantiate the crucial role of the aquatic ecosystems in carbon fixation. Secondly, in order to comprehend the intricate interactions within the Earth system, we employ eight machine learning models to predict carbon emissions. We observe that extremely randomized trees (ET) exhibit the highest predictive accuracy among these models. Thirdly, in interpreting the ET model, we utilize Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE). Our 3D-SHAP analysis reveals heterogeneity in the emission effects of wastewater treatment across different sub-groups, indicating that emissions are especially sensitive to increased wastewater treatment in agricultural and tourism cities. Furthermore, 3D-SHAP analysis of the aquatic ecosystems exhibits a series of spikes, signifying that aquatic plants will abruptly lose their carbon storage ability once the degradation of the aquatic ecosystems exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, our ALE evaluation, depicting the dispersion tendency of feature importance, identifies the uncertainty of wastewater carbon release in agricultural and tourism cities, while also affirming the vulnerability of the aquatic ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic ecosystems; Carbon emissions; Machine learning; Structural equation modeling; Wastewater treatment, China; Agriculture; Aquatic ecosystems; Digital storage; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Machine learning; Reclamation; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; sulfur dioxide; carbon; Carbon emissions; Environmental pollutions; Environmental strategy; Fossil fuel consumption; Local effects; Machine-learning; Randomized trees; Shapley; Structural equation models; Water cycle; aquatic ecosystem; aquatic plant; carbon emission; machine learning; multivariate analysis; wastewater treatment; aquatic environment; Article; artificial intelligence; atmosphere; biosphere; carbon emission; carbon fixation; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; decision tree; greenhouse effect; human; hydrosphere; lithosphere; machine learning; mining; nonhuman; pollution; predictive value; reliability; socioeconomics; spawning; structural equation modeling; support vector machine; tourism; waste water management; water cycle; article; carbon storage; degradation; dispersion; machine learning; structural equation modeling; tight junction; vulnerability; wastewater; Wastewater treatment",English,Article,300,11,Rural Resource Management

Moreover, toxins produced from some cyanoHABs threaten human and animal health. Climate warming can affect the distribution of cyanoHABs, where rising temperatures facilitate more intense blooms and a greater distribution of cyanoHABs in inland freshwater. Nutrient runoff from adjacent watersheds is also a major driver of cyanoHAB formation. While some of the physicochemical factors behind cyanoHAB dynamics are known, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the conditions that trigger and sustain cyanoHABs over time. In this perspective, we suggest that sufficient data sets, as well as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, are available to build a comprehensive model of cyanoHAB dynamics based on integrated environmental/climate, nutrient/water chemistry, and cyanoHAB microbiome and ‘omics data to identify key factors contributing to HAB formation, intensity, and toxicity. By taking a holistic approach to the analysis of all available data, including the rapidly growing number of biological data sets, we can provide the foundational knowledge needed to address the increasing threat of cyanoHABs to the security of our water resources. © 2023 The Authors.

Businesses must change their operations to become more ecologically friendly due to stakeholders' increased awareness of environmental issues, both internal and external. This research aims to examine and analyze how green entrepreneurship affects business performance and green innovation. Additionally, the moderating effect of the business environment and the mediating role of green innovation within the connections are also considered in this study. 245 business players and strategic decision-makers in green tourism enterprises based in four East Javan cities-Malang, Surabaya, Pasuruan, and Bojonegoro-responded to this study. Respondents are given online surveys to complete to gather data, further examined using the Smart PLS software and structural equation modeling with partial least squares. The conclusions show that green innovation drives company performance and that green entrepreneurship substantially impacts both. Additionally, this research validates that green innovation partially mediates the relationship between green entrepreneurship and company performance. It has been established that the business environment cannot enhance the impact of green entrepreneurship on firm performance, hence serving as a moderating factor. Ultimately, our research suggests that green entrepreneurship has a significant role in the eco-friendly tourism context since it can improve business performance and spur innovation.  © 2024 The authors.","business environment; firm performance; green business practice; green entrepreneurship; green innovation, environmental economics; green economy; industrial performance; innovation; least squares method; tourism",English,Article,232,11,Rural Resource Management

However, some points of interest may be located away from the accommodation i.e. in a different city of a metropolitan area. In this case, cycling to the attractions may not be possible and multimodal bike and public transport trips can be considered for more sustainable tourism. Therefore, it is essential to identify how adequate a city transport infrastructures and services are for these types of trips. In this paper, we propose a cycling indicator for tourism accessibility with the aim of defining the level of multimodal bike-public transport friendliness through numerical values related to a specific zone in the main city of a metropolitan area. The indicator was applied to the metropolitan area of Bari (Italy) and results showed that the presence of bike lanes and bike-sharing plays an important role. © 2024 Institute for Transport Studies in the European Economic Integration.

The combination of significant increases in carbon (COD) and nitrogen (N) loads by a factor of four to five within a short periode of time and low wastewater temperatures (<12 °C), represents a bottleneck in meeting essential effluent requirements. According to literature research, however, little attention has been paid to these special framework conditions for wastewater treatment. Based on this fact, a model-based simulation study of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Montafon (Austria) evaluates operational optimization approaches for the above-mentioned framework conditions and is intended to provide new insights for nitrification-optimized and energy-optimized wastewater treatment. The WWTP Montafon is designed for a COD load of 6250 kg d−1, a daily dry weather water discharge of 12,700 m3 d−1 and is a typical plant in a winter tourism region. The 5 studied smart operation approaches shown are a combination of two different aeration control strategies based on a time-controlled (i) or ammonia-based feedback aeration control (ABAC) (ii) for intermittent nitrification-denitrification and sludge removal control strategies based on a constant sludge concentration to 3 g L−1 (iii), a constant sludge retention time (SRT) to 20 days (iv) and a constant sludge retention time to 20 days combined with a higher level sludge concentration control to max. 3 g L−1 (v). The simulation results show that a combination of a time-controlled aeration strategy and controlling the sludge concentration to a constant 3 g L−1 is not recommended in order to comply with the emission limits. Under the mentioned influent conditions, ABAC control alone does not inevitably lead to a nitrification-optimized process and reduction in energy consumption. Sufficient nitrifying bacteria in the activated sludge are the key to a nitrification optimized process and reduction of energy consumption for aeration. Hence, a combination of an intermittent aeration control based on ammonium measurement and a constant sludge retention time to 20 days is preferable for nitrification capacity and is the most energy-efficient control strategy to obtain required COD and N effluent quality. An average energy consumption of 57–63 Wh PE120−1 d−1 for the aeration is to be expected for combinations of (i,iv), (ii, iii) (ii,iv) and (ii,v) which is low in relation to the influent challenges and to plants with higher wastewater temperatures (>12 °C) between 27 Wh PE120−1 d−1 and 121 Wh PE120−1 d−1 according to literature. The approach with a time-controlled intermittent aeration and a SRT to constant 20 days was implemented at the WWTP Montafon and confirms the results of the associated simulation. According to this simulation study, a 35 % increase in nitrification capacity in existing WWTPs designed as activated sludge processes can be achieved through optimized operating conditions without additional high investments. © 2024 The Authors",", Activated sludge processes; Aeration and sludge removal control; Low temperature; N and COD peak loads; Winter tourism",English,Article,478,3,Urban Sustainability

The results reveal an increase in scientific output. Endogenous resources and the Tourism-culture-leisure sectors consistently buttressed the drive toward specialization, both prior to and after the RIS3 implementation. Healthsocial well-being and ICT digital economy sectors did not exhibit unequivocal indicators endorsing specialization, yet they demonstrated marked improvements in quality. Meanwhile, certain fields failed to show significant growth and, in some cases, exhibited deterioration: Mobility and logistics and Transport industry, especially when compared to national and European benchmarks.

Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is a transport intervention, still in its infancy, promising, in theory at least, significant benefits for societies by disengaging travel from automobility via a ‘one-stop digital shop’ offering integrated multimodal transport services. However, these benefits, ranging from improved and more affordable access to transport to less motorised traffic and pollution, largely depend on how stakeholders will choose to adopt, deliver and manage this intervention. Identifying and understanding the distinct perceptions of a diverse spectrum of stakeholders around MaaS may therefore help in efforts to create a formula that will allow building schemes that are attractive to users and effective operationally. This study uses for the first time for the context of MaaS the powerful semi-quantitative Q-method with a sample of 50 expert participants from 17 countries to collect, contextualise and prioritise their key insights. These stakeholders are governmental representants, transport consultants, leading academics and researchers working directly or indirectly on MaaS and sustainable/shared mobility programmes. Our analysis led to the identification of three factors (i.e., clusters of respondents with similar views), each with their specific priorities and preferences, namely: the Cultural Shift Proponents, the Policy Advocates, and the Technology Supporters. The Cultural Shift Proponents see the introduction of MaaS as part of a cultural shift away from automobility, Policy Advocates recognise the predominant role of rules and regulations in pushing forward this paradigm, and the Technology Supporters see technology integration as a facilitator to its success. This study highlights the limited governmental involvement in MaaS planning and delivery, the absence of a clear plan when it comes to mobility providers, the need to provide well-branded, sustainable and inclusive schemes for commuters, tourists and vulnerable users including awareness-raising activities, and the importance of keeping user costs modest and usage data safe. © 2024 The Authors","Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS); Q-method; Sustainable and smart mobility; Transport policy and planning; Transport stakeholders, Sustainable development; Cultural shift; Environmental economics; Mobility-as-a-service; Q method; Socio-economics; Stakeholder perception; Sustainable and smart mobility; Transport planning; Transport policy; Transport stakeholder; advocacy; perception; policy analysis; stakeholder; sustainability; transportation planning; transportation policy; Environmental technology",English,Article,326,4,Mobility and Transportation

However, commercial and tourism development has altered the natural contexts of these geoparks, diminishing their initial value. Before implementing land use policies, spatial landscape parameters should be monitored in multiple dimensions and in real time. This study aims to develop Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet) models employing an upgraded U-structured neural network in order to monitor land use/cover changes and landscape indicators in a Vietnamese UGGp. This network has proven effective at preserving input image data and restricting the loss of spatial information in decoding data. To demonstrate the utility of deep learning, eight trained BiSeNet models were evaluated against Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. The trained BSN-Nadam model (128x128), with a precision of 94% and an information loss of 0.1, can become a valuable instrument for analyzing and monitoring monthly changes in land uses/covers once tourism activities have been rapidly expanded. Three tourist routes and 41 locations in the Dak Nong UGGp were monitored for 30 years using three landscape indices: Disjunct Core Area Density (DCAD), Total Edge Contrast Index (TECI), Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI), based on the results of the model. As a result, 18 identified geo-sites in the Daknong Geopark have been influenced significantly by agricultural and tourist activities since 2010, making these sites less uniform and unsustainable management.

However, given the pace of processes of smartification and digitalization taking place elsewhere, this lax pace of developments, along with weak infrastructure, cultural issues, and a lack of skills, may turn into a significant barrier to growth and development. In order to promote wise and sustainable small town/city development, this chapter examines how residents of small towns perceive the spatial redesign of the urban surroundings. The discussion in this chapter focuses on a small town in southern Italy, Castellabate, where despite being a popular tourist destination, slowness is the norm and is seen as a good way of living. Thirty-five responses to semi-structured interviews with residents were collected and evaluated. The results suggest that topics associated with the city’s smart transition are related to the continuous improvement of the quality of life for both residents and tourists. They also include public infrastructure, smart mobility, energy efficiency, control, and safety when conceptualizing the redesign of urban environments, in addition to digitalization and multi-service platforms. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Anna Visvizi and Hanna Godlewska-Majkowska; individual chapters, the contributors.",,English,Book chapter,198,3,Urban Sustainability

At the same time, based on an analysis of recent investment schemes implemented under the public-private partnership (PPP) models in Istanbul, this chapter examines their impact on Istanbul’s development as a smart city. It is argued that PPP, viewed as a tool for implementing modern solutions in cities, is a highly efficient tool, as it enables city authorities to implement complex, expensive, and technologically extensive changes in the fabric of the city in a relatively short period of time.

The study investigates complex relationships involving the independent variable (green building technologies), the mediator (green tourism supply chain management), and four dependent variables: (renewable energy generation, waste-to-energy generation, community energy engagement, and energy storage and energy security). Employing a quantitative approach, data was collected from 618 tourism stakeholders through simple random sampling and the Krejcie and Morgan method. Questionnaires were administered using Google Forms, and data analysis was conducted using Smart Pls 3 software. The T-statistics values for all 13 direct and indirect hypotheses exceeded the threshold of 1.96, ranging from a minimum of 2.132 to a maximum of 12.808, indicating a statistically significant positive correlation among all variables. The results demonstrate the universality of energy sustainability theory within the tourism supply chain, offering actionable insights for policy implementation and incentives that facilitate decentralized and robust energy transitions. The empirical framework equips policymakers with effective strategies for prioritizing investments in areas like green building technologies, waste management, community engagement, and sustainable supply chains.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to find suitable criteria for assessing the attractiveness of a natural area such as a geopark in order to find the best quantifiable method as a methodological guide to evaluate attractiveness. The principle of the methodology takes into account three facts: the use of available attractiveness methods elaborated over time, the UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGp) geopark requirements, and a certified geopark (Haţeg UNESCO Global Geopark was chosen as etalon—benchmark), then matching these together. To this end, the following specific objectives have been set: (i) an inventory of factors used to estimate attractiveness; (ii) through analysis, identifying the appropriate evaluation criteria for the field (a set for criteria’s SMART parameter, which can be clearly expressed, quantitatively measurable, and achievable); and (iii) developing a methodological guideline for geopark attractiveness assessment. The methodology is based on an analytical thinking approach, builds on the experience of existing methods, and stands out by the attributes matched to the UGGp’s evaluation criteria using the certified geopark as a benchmark.

Design/methodology/approach: The research integrated geographic information systems (GIS) to map tourist attractions against high-resolution annual emissions data. The analysis covered 3,108 US counties, focusing on county-level attraction densities and annual on-road CO2 emission patterns. Advanced spatial analysis techniques, including bivariate mapping and local bivariate relationship testing, were employed to assess potential correlations. Findings: The findings reveal limited evidence of significant associations between tourism activities and transportation-based CO2 emissions around major urban centers, with decreases observed in Eastern states and the Midwest, particularly in non-coastal areas, from 2003 to 2022. Most counties (86.03%) show no statistically significant relationship between changes in tourism density and on-road CO2 emissions. However, 1.90% of counties show a positive linear relationship, 2.64% a negative linear relationship, 0.29% a concave relationship, 1.61% a convex relationship and 7.63% a complex, undefined relationship. Despite this, the 110% national growth in tourism output and resource consumption from 2003–2022 raises potential sustainability concerns. Practical implications: To tackle sustainability issues in tourism, policymakers and stakeholders can integrate emissions accounting, climate modeling and sustainability governance. Effective interventions are vital for balancing tourism demands with climate resilience efforts promoting social equity and environmental justice. Originality/value: This study’s innovative application of geospatial modeling and comprehensive spatial analysis provides new insights into the complex relationship between tourism activities and CO2 emissions. The research highlights the challenges in isolating tourism’s specific impacts on emissions and underscores the need for more granular geographic assessments or comprehensive emission inventories to fully understand tourism’s environmental footprint. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",", Climate resilience; Emission modeling; Geospatial analysis; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Tourism sustainability",English,Article,283,11,Rural Resource Management

Depending on this development, new tourism products emerge and tourism destinations are created. The increase in the number of tourists visiting the destination does not exceed the carrying capacity for that region and causes pressure on the social, cultural, and environmental structure. This situation undoubtedly affects the sustainability of tourism negatively. It is thought that the recent technological developments are extremely important in preventing these negativities. Smart city application is one of these technological developments. In this research, it is aimed to evaluate the effects of smart city applications on the sustainability of tourism destinations depending on the cause-and-effect relationship. Smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart life are the prominent dimensions in smart city applications. In the study, it was concluded that these dimensions positively affect social, cultural, economic, and environmental sustainability such as the inclusion of local people in the decision-making process, the use of autonomous robots, the protection of cultural assets, energy saving, use of renewable energy, and management of scarce resources. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.",", Smart city; Sustainability; Sustainable tourism; Tourism; Tourism destination",English,Book chapter,185,3,Urban Sustainability

Studies have concluded that these differences are largely attributable to household responsibilities typically falling disproportionately on women, leading to women being more likely to utilize transit for purposes referred to by the umbrella concept of “Mobility of Care”. In contrast to past studies that have quantified the impact of gender using survey and qualitative data, we examine a novel data-driven workflow utilizing a combination of previously developed origin, destination, and transfer inference (ODX) based on individual transit fare card transactions, name-based gender inference, and geospatial analysis as a framework to identify mobility of care trip making. We apply this framework to data from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Analyzing data from millions of journeys conducted in the first quarter of 2019, the results of this study show that our proposed workflow can identify mobility of care travel behavior, both in terms of (1) detecting times and places of interest where the share of women travelers in an equally-sampled subset (on basis of inferred gender) of transit users is 10 %–15 % higher than that of men, and (2) finding women significantly more likely to exhibit a consistent accompaniment patterns with riders who are children, elderly, or people with disabilities. The workflow presented in this study provides a blueprint for combining transit origin-destination data, inferred customer demographics, and geospatial analyses enabling public transit agencies to assess, at the fare card level, the gendered impacts of different policy and operational decisions. © 2024 The Authors",", Mobility of Care; Public Transport; Women in Transit",English,Article,257,4,Mobility and Transportation

59298135800,Origin of the Spanish Smart Tourism Destinations Program,2024,"This chapter traces the development of the Smart Tourism Destinations program. We propose understanding the programme as the result of the convergence of two lines of work of the Spanish central government’s tourism administration: on the one hand, the development of tourism quality systems and their approach of working with indicators and, on the other hand, the design and implementation of programmes aimed at improving destination management. The development of the programmes relates to the spread of new concepts, such as total quality, or new programmes in other areas of public policy such as Agenda 21 for local sustainability. This chapter is structured from a historical perspective. The analysis allows for reaching several conclusions: firstly, that the government plays a major role in the promotion of innovative tools, or at least it has done so in terms of destination management; secondly, that the development of public policy programmes is more successful if it is based on the hybridization of ideas that arise from different contexts; and finally, that programmes experience more interesting and lasting growth if what they propose is useful to the parties to whom they are directed.

This study employs the destination sustainability theory to examine the perceptions of tourism business managers on the impacts of climate change on tourism activities in selected tourist centres in Zimbabwe. A qualitative research approach was adopted in which in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 managerial employees selected through purposive and snow ball sampling strategies. Participants were drawn from multiple study sites, namely Nyanga and Chimanimani; Hwange, Victoria Falls, and Binga; Kariba, Lake Chivero, Mana pools; and Gonarezhou. Findings showed that the perception of tourism facilities managers towards climate change were varied, with managers mostly concerned about climate change induced risk of flooding, shortened tourists vacation time, delayed opening of facilities, damage to supportive tourism infrastructure, loss of biodiversity and reduced capacity utilisation. Additionally, findings reveal that tourism is highly sensitive and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change in the selected study sites due to mediating variables encompassing over-dependence on tourism resources sensitive to climate change, an undiversified tourism market base, and reliance on outdoor tourist activities, coupled with other site specific variables. Overall, tourist sites lack adaptive capacity to recover from the impacts of climate change, hence the adoption of a wide range of smart climate change proofing strategies, notably sinking of boreholes to alleviate water shortages, translocation of wildlife, clearing blocked roads, rehabilitating damaged bridges, investing in energy saving appliances, and green energy. The findings of the study underscore the need for tourism facilities managers to adopt a climate change centric approach when developing climate change proofing strategies to enhance the sustainability and resilience of the sector. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",", Climate change; Destination sustainability framework; Nature-based tourism; Perception; Resilience; Vulnerability",English,Article,283,11,Rural Resource Management

One such prominent system in South Asia, called tank irrigation, initially thrived through community management but declined post-independence due to colonial policies and neglect in Sri Lanka and India. This study evaluates current policy frameworks and rehabilitation programs to enhance the resilience of these systems in India, develop strategies for their protection and adaptation to climate change, and integrate global lessons for sustainable development. Methods: A systematic meta-analysis of grey literature was conducted to aggregate data on policy constraints. Policy analysis involved detailed investigations of relevant documents, regulations, and comparative analyses of frameworks at regional and national levels. Pilot projects on tank rehabilitation were assessed through reported case studies and field surveys to gauge impact. Thematic analysis was used to explore the global potential of these systems in climate resilience and overall environmental sustainability. Results: The analysis showed that pilot projects for tank rehabilitation had limited success in achieving sustainability under current climate conditions. Tank irrigation systems are crucial for adapting to extreme weather, including floods, droughts, and heat waves, replenishing groundwater, reducing soil erosion, and ensuring reliable water supplies. Traditional water harvesting technologies support 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including clean water access, hunger reduction, gender equality, and climate action. Integrating AI and machine learning in water management benefits disaster response, while eco-tourism aids system maintenance and cultural awareness. Discussion: The study underscores the need for policy reforms to enhance tank rehabilitation and institutional arrangements. It calls for increased beneficiary participation and constitutional recognition of current practices. Strategic, national-scale assessments and resilience targets are recommended to improve the effectiveness of such water harvesting systems in mitigating natural hazards and enhancing environmental services.

The chapter proposes to consider tourism from a different and more holistic perspective: Tourism should not be viewed only as an economic engine that sells services, but as an activity that is part of a global natural and socio-cultural system which is impacted by tourism (both positively and negatively) and that should also contribute to improvement and sustainability. It discusses how smart destinations require innovative development, management, and marketing solutions to address those challenges and trends to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs). Finally, the chapter introduces and proposes the model of the Spanish Secretariat of State for Tourism, developed by SEGITTUR, for the Smart Tourism Management. © Sociedad Mercantil Estatal para la Gestión de la Innovación y las Tecnologías Turísticas, S.A.M.P. 2024.",", Challenges; Destinations; Future; Governance; Management; SDGs; Smart destinations; Tourism; Trends",English,Book chapter,176,3,Urban Sustainability

However, conservation-based tourism development, climate change, local inclusion, and post-human-wildlife co-existence conflicts in African Transfrontier Conservation Areas, is still limited especially as joint field. The study area is described and presented using maps and cartographic illustrations to picture territorial boundaries. The discussion upholds evidence on symbiotic linkage between the effects of climate change and communities whose livelihoods are impacted by these effects. The increase in population and migration into lands close to national parks has led to humans encroaching on wildlife habitats, exacerbating human-wildlife co-existence conflicts. On the other hand, conservation-based tourism development initiatives are perceived by locals as only involving elite communities, excluding many. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns have exacerbated the impact of the above-raised factors. There is a paucity of information about this complexity from the perspective of the human behavioural lens. In this context, effects, challenges, trends, opportunities, and solutions/practices are yet to be explored. This chapter aimed to fill the gap by assessing trends and patterns in research-based knowledge, with Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, as a case study while setting a research agenda for the research community in post-COVID-19 health crisis. A critical-scoping review analysis was used while following Creswell qualitative analysis framework to analyse research data from Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Sabinet databases between 2000 and 2023. Based on maps, and cartographic illustrations, there are territorial changes over the period as society (territorial boundaries, activities, cultures and learnt behaviours of people), environment (climatic changes, and composition of biodiversity) and COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures propelled a ‘cause-effect’ for human-wildlife co-existence conflicts (illegal hunting of wildlife and over-harvest of herbs and wood included). Within this context, the study unveiled four areas, namely: (i) limited evidence on local community/household (stakeholders) engagement; (ii) a paucity of human-behavioural focused models/theories in post-human-wildlife conflicts; (iii) limited knowledge of the nexus between the topics under consideration and multi-disciplinary research; and (iv) the need to document theory-in-practice, strategies, potential opportunities, and solutions to challenges. The study assessed the trends and patterns prevailing in conservation-based tourism development, climate change, local inclusion, post-human-wildlife co-existence conflicts and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures in communities around Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. There are changes in vegetation, land use as well as the composition of biodiversity. Conservation authorities should balance perceived value on the wellbeing of communities and biodiversity in initiatives aimed at conserving the biodiversity in the Gonarezhou National Park. The study derived insights that can be used to establish actionable strategies for local community participation and involvement in conservation-based tourism, empowerment and alternative livelihoods that brings resilience and better conservation and preservation of biodiversity using indigenous knowledge systems (community intelligence) while mitigating climatic changes and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. The study recommends future in-depth empirical research on the complexity of interactions between conservation-based tourism development, climate change, local inclusion, and post-human-wildlife co-existence conflicts.

It is the evolution of previous research developed in 2021 and completes its original strategical picture with further considerations. The research question is how to reactivate Gijrokaster’s economy and development by leveraging existing resources, applying modern smart technologies, and focusing on a holistic perspective driven by the urban design and planning of the city. The results of the research are the definition of realistic urban planning and design strategy that could be applied to Gjirokaster. Other results are the application of smart technologies into an urban development or recovery strategy, and the creative and adaptive use of existing buildings and space to introduce new factors in city development. Future results could be the abstraction of the used methodology to define a general approach to identify space for improvement or recovery in crumbling cities. The methodological approach of the paper starts from the analysis of the Gjirokaster urban context, its history and its potential, and provides a strategy to generate a virtuous loop that leads to Gijrokaster rebirth, leveraging both traditional resources (like tourism and agriculture) but also leveraging other local resources (university, hospital, industrial area, natural resources, …) to create a synergy capable to start, in a sustainable and manageable way, the rebirth of the city.

Initially, it was a tool for better describing the economic activity of companies that were geographically concentrated and based on knowledge. In practice, the cluster model helps to understand how the companies that make it up are connected, how they are interdependent, and also how they will become more competitive, appreciating how important each of them is. The aim is to clearly define the concept of a cluster today, as well as the reasons that make its creation beneficial for all the companies that make it up without being competitive and since the companies themselves create an added value. Choosing the correct research methodology can determine the success and overall quality of the report as well as the impact of the project. Choosing Qualitative research method to collect the data for this report, achieved by interviewing key persons of the Troodos Region, from different sectors of the daily life, i.e., tourism industry, local authorities, Troodos organizations using a semi-structured questionnaire giving them the opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings regarding the creation of a new cluster in the local tourism industry and facing their worries and potential risks. From the other side, focus groups in each subregion of Troodos offer the chance of inviting a limited number of individuals in common physical environment to discuss in an organized way with the help of one or more mediators about clustering in Troodos region and a series of interrelated issues. Through this study answer the question: How the tourism clusters in Troodos and a pilot project began from Platres, will provide platforms of local economic development, growth and innovation of new and existing enterprises in the tourism industry, through trusted cooperation and creative complementarity, especially in a small economy like Platres, whereas as the economists state “Small is beautiful”, in the sense that tourism clusters in Platres, can be easily managed with a great impact and results. From what has been said above, there is no doubt that a number of actions should be taken with the ultimate goal of strengthening clusters in the tourism, in order to stimulate and develop innovation, but also competitiveness between companies of all sectors of the wider economy and especially the tourism sector. In fact, by strengthening the clusters, it is possible to promote competitiveness, as well as encouraging businesses to be productive, as well as developing entrepreneurship.

Additionally, UNWTO released the “Statistical Framework for Measuring Sustainable Tourism” in December 2022, a conceptual framework designed to facilitate the collection and presentation of data on the economic, environmental, and social impacts of tourism. The integration of SEEA into the SF-MST has significantly upgraded the ability of SF-MST, to provide information on the environmental dimension of tourism, since the system of environmental-economic accounting (SEEA) 2012 is the general international statistical standard for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy. Alongside the development of the industry's tool capabilities, new opportunities are emerging for both the collection of environment-related data and its reliable processing and transformation into comparable data, from which sustainability statements (ESG and others) will be compiled, as well as provide UNWTO SF-MST with reliable information. This paper aims to contribute to the development of an environmental management accounting model applicable to the tourism industry by utilizing the opportunities offered by Industry 4.0. This model will provide management with reliable information and facilitate the compilation of reliable and comparable environmental reports, which will capture the environmental impacts of tourism on crucial environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste, wastewater, disruption of ecosystems and biodiversity, water, energy efficiency, beaches, ecosystem protection, environmental protection costs, environmental taxes, and will facilitate the implementation and use of environmental management accounting systems, using business intelligence techniques which will contribute to the analysis, evaluation, documentation, and transparency of their environmental performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",", Business intelligence; Economic; Environment; Industry 4.0; Statistical frame for measuring sustainable tourism; Sustainable tourism; Tourism industries",English,Conference paper,308,11,Rural Resource Management

Despite this significant potential, these resources have not been optimally utilized to boost economic growth. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the competitive advantage of the Blue Economy sector by enhancing the outcomes of the tourism, processing, and sales of fisheries in Indonesia through the Resource-Based View (RBV) theory. The Resource-Based View theory explains the formulation and creation of competitive advantages by utilizing tangible and intangible resources such as innovation, strategy, capability, and culture. This study employs a quantitative method through an online survey with a total of 319 respondents working in the Blue Economy sector, including fisheries, marine product sellers, and marine tourism. The analytical methodology uses Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with SMART PLS to assess the determination of competitive advantage. The findings of this study show that capabilities, operational capabilities, response capabilities, technological capabilities, innovation culture, innovation strategy, and strategic alignment significantly influence competitive advantage. Moreover, the competitive advantage in the blue economy sector is most influenced by innovation strategy with a beta of 0.375. This suggests that enhancing innovation strategies can positively impact Indonesia’s fisheries industry, as evidenced by fisheries tourism being the largest tourism sector in Indonesia, competing with international tourism.

12796188100,Distant time: The future of urbanisation from ‘there’ and ‘then’,2024,"Recent geographical scholarship has mainly focussed on the disjunctures between linear and cyclical time in urban development. This paper proposes a notion of distant time as a metaphor of temporal power that keeps marginal citizens at a governable distance from the state. Taking the case of Shimla, an erstwhile Summer Capital of colonial India and a popular tourist town in the Himalayas, it argues that distant time emerges from the temporal reordering of ‘native’ settlement on a fragile ecological landscape ravaged by the colonial state, that is then repeated in postcolonial imaginaries of smart urban futures. Reading ‘along the grain’ of colonial archives of incremental housebuilding by the ‘natives’, as well as interviews with current working class residents of Shimla living under threat of demolition from proposed smart city projects, this paper suggests that distant time is also a space for marginal citizens to claim temporal justice. Even as the state engages in temporal distancing through post/colonial planning, marginal citizens use waiting, confusing, and circumventing as tools of temporal arbitrage. They highlight that aspirations for smart urban futures are not just produced in the ‘here and now’ of the present, but also from the ‘there and then’ of different pasts and futures. © The Author(s) 2024.",", Colonial archives; distant time; planning; smart city; statecraft; technology; temporal arbitrage; temporal distance; urban future; urbanisation",English,Article,206,3,Urban Sustainability

The rapid technological progress of autonomous vehicles among other benefits derived from truck platooning, convinced many that the concept could transform road freight transport. However, despite the optimistic expected fuel savings by the early conducted research due to the aerodynamic drag of a convoy of trucks, actual savings are questionable and debatable as depend on many parameters (intervehicle distance, road topology, position in the platoon, etc.). The actual profitability of truck platooning strongly relies on the operational conditions of the system. This paper investigates impactful operational conditions (i.e., travel time, driver compensation ration, platoon capacity, and arrival time deadline) as well as quantifies monetary savings taking into consideration fuel emission reduction by hybrid truck platooning implementation. Multiple network instances are developed and used to evaluate the proposed model. Results indicate that cost savings reach 50% when compared to the shortest origin-destination path and suggest that the optimal hybrid truck platoon capacity is five trucks. © 2024 IEEE.",", Drag reduction; Emission control; Freight transportation; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Roads and streets; Travel time; Trucks; Autonomous Vehicles; Emission reduction; Fuel emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heavy duty vehicles; Hybrid trucks; Operational conditions; Optimistics; Road freight transport; Technological progress; Aerodynamic drag",English,Conference paper,174,4,Mobility and Transportation

We use a generalized method of moments technique, novel index of tourism, and ICT in 130 countries from 1995 to 2019. The empirical results infer an increase in tourism due to sustained growth in ICT (all panels), economic growth (all panels), FDI (all panels), financial development (all panels), and infrastructure development (all panels). This study highlights the importance of increasing 4G networking in remote areas and introducing reliable mobile applications to promote smart tourism, which involves setting up a Tourist Information Centre to guide tourists in terms of traveling, accommodation, food, shopping, parking, history of specific places, healthcare services, weather forecasting, and emergencies. The central bank could ensure price stability by using different tools of monetary and fiscal policy while encouraging FDI and ICT infrastructure in the tourism industry, especially in developing countries. Tourism is directly associated with foreign exchange earnings, which in turn increases the financial strength of an economy. Besides, prioritizing investment in infrastructure, particularly in sanitation and waste management, drinking water supply, clean fuel management, and generation of electricity, could bolster tourism.

However, an important problem persists since AFC data only includes information about the trip within the public transport system, that is stop-to-stop (tap-in to tap-out). Not knowing the full trip from door-to-door might lead to estimation bias, especially when estimating route choice models based on only the chosen stops, which is common practice in current research using AFC data. To avoid this, we propose an improved method for estimating route choice models in public transport using AFC data. The method is based on randomly generating pseudo origin (and destination) points in close vicinity of the actually chosen origin (and destination) stops, thus allowing pseudo access and egress times to be incorporated into the route choice model. The framework is compatible with any probability density function. We suggest using the Beta distribution for generating points when knowledge about access and egress distances are available, whereas the Uniform distribution is suggested when no knowledge is available. The method was applied on replicated AFC data based on traditional travel survey data from the Greater Copenhagen area in Denmark. The results of the model estimations confirm estimation bias in parameter estimates when not correcting for the lack of access/egress information. The proposed method notably improves in-vehicle-time parameter estimates of the route choice model compared to estimation assuming AFC stop-to-stop data, whereas access/egress time and hidden waiting time parameters are still biased, although to a lesser extent than a traditional naïve estimation based on stop-to-stop data. © 2023 The Author(s)","Choice Set; Discrete choice modelling; Estimation bias; Public transport; Route choice modelling; Smart card data, Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden; Parameter estimation; Probability density function; Taps; Transportation routes; Automated fare collection; Choice set; Discrete choice models; Egress time; Estimation bias; Origin and destinations; Parameters estimates; Public transport; Route choice model; Smart card data; data; discrete choice analysis; estimation method; modeling; public transport; travel behavior; Smart cards",English,Article,271,4,Mobility and Transportation

The region is subject to thunderstorms and tropical cyclones that can generate damaging winds. The Severe Wind Hazard Assessment for South East Queensland evaluates the risk posed by severe winds and has strategies for managing this risk (Edwards et al. 2022). Results from the most recent assessment showed that older residential houses were the most damaged by severe winds and that this contributed disproportionately to community risk. However, lessons from recent wind damage caused by Tropical Cyclone Seroja in Western Australia in 2021 indicated that modern house designs have important vulnerabilities. These findings are a concern for any exposed coastal area and, in particular, for South East Queensland. This paper presents a suite of scenarios developed to address this vulnerability. Specifically, we describe how emergency and disaster managers can conduct capability analyses with the goal to enhance intelligence and planning capabilities. An example of the City of Gold Coast was used to show how it has leveraged these capabilities to improve emergency risk-based planning and begin a community resilience transformation with effective places of refuge and evacuation centres for the community. © 2024 by the authors.

Researchers have explored how green space characteristics, such as size, theme, and convenience, influence urban movement. However, an important aspect that has received limited attention is the relative attractiveness of green spaces. When residents have access to similar green spaces nearby, their inclination to visit more distant ones decreases. This leads to the central research question: How does the relative attractiveness of urban green spaces affect urban movements? The existing literature lacks a comprehensive theory to address this question. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the Potential to Kinetic Energy (PKE) framework, inspired by principles from physics. In this framework, potential energy represents the relative attractiveness of green spaces between the travel origin and destination, while kinetic energy signifies the urban movement resulting from the this attractiveness. To demonstrate the PKE framework's applicability, this paper analyzes green space data and smart card subway ridership records from Beijing. The results show that a unit increase in size, cultural, attraction, proximity, and location potential energy is associated with a 0.22%, 0.27%, 0.14%, 0.19%, and 0.02% increase in urban movement. The findings provide compelling evidence for the significant role of relative attractiveness in shaping urban movements and offer valuable insights for urban planning and policy development. The proposal of the PKE framework encourages interdisciplinary discussions among urban planners, environmental scientists, and transportation experts, fostering collaborative efforts to enhance the sustainability of cities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",", Kinetics; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Smart cards; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Green spaces; Limited attentions; Origin and destinations; Paper analysis; Quality of life; Research questions; Space between; Space data; Urban green spaces; Well being; Kinetic energy",English,Article,252,3,Urban Sustainability

The case of a small-scale Hungarian heritage city,2024,"Small-scale heritage towns usually face fierce competition from surrounding destinations, particularly in peripheral rural areas where tourism holds important possibilities for regional development. This study examines on-site smart tourism technology as a tool to increase attractiveness and differentiation of heritage destinations using examples of Hungarian destinations. The research seeks to answer the question whether a small-scale heritage destination can become a more attractive destination due to technology from the perspective of potential tourists. The paper analyzes quantitative data collected from 537 potential tourists. Principal component analysis was used to identify the factors considering attractive and differential on-site technologies. A regression model was created to examine how these factors affect the potential tourist's decision-making: whether heritage towns with smart on-site tools are too similar to towns that do not use such technologies. Three factors of on-site technologies have been identified: digital sightseeing, smart attractions, and smart infrastructure. According to the regression model, digital sightseeing is the key pull factor, but smart attractions and smart infrastructure also have a positive effect in small towns. The study presents the first empirical research on the effect of smart technology on positioning small-size heritage towns based on demand-side research. © 2023 The Author(s).

We developed a binary discrete choice model to assess the factors affecting the changes of the bus line, including the time of day, peak periods, day of the week, number of trips taken by users, type of user, and destination of the trip. We address some research gaps identified in the recent literature by examining factors that influence user behaviour in addition to uncovering urban mobility patterns. The results of a Logit choice model are discussed considering the attributes of the service and of the journey to support evidence-based policy making for adapting bus service design, drawing insights from extensive smart card dataset analysis. Our findings indicate that users are generally inclined to bus line shifts than using the same lines, with such changes occurring more frequently during late hours and inter-peak periods compared to the morning and afternoon peak hours. Additionally, regular users are more likely to change lines than occasional users, and trips with discounts and smart card usage for transfers on trips home tend to involve different lines. Several policy measures can be considered to mitigate passenger discomfort associated with changing bus lines and to reduce operational costs arising from multiple lines serving the same locations. These include investing in promotional efforts to enhance the image of specific bus lines, prioritising certain lines during the day to minimise travel times and retain passengers on the same bus, adjusting line frequencies to reduce the need for transfers, and offering additional incentives to frequent users. Implementing discounts in corridors with shorter travel times can also encourage passengers to remain on the same buses. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",", Behaviour; Bus line shift; Public transport; Smart card",English,Article,307,4,Mobility and Transportation

With the gradual recovery from COVID-19 and more people returning to work from the office, the transmission of COVID-19 during commuting becomes a concern. Recent emerging mobility services (such as ride-hailing and bike-sharing) further deteriorate the infection risks due to shared vehicles or spaces during travel. Hence, it is important to quantify the infection risks in commuting. This paper proposes a probabilistic framework to estimate the risk of infection during an individual's commute considering different travel modes, including public transit, ride-share, bike, and walking. The objective is to evaluate the probability of infection as well as the estimation errors (i.e., uncertainty quantification) given the origin-destination (OD), departure time, and travel mode. We first define a general trip planning function to generate trip trajectories and probabilities of choosing different paths according to the OD, departure time, and travel mode. Then, we consider two channels of infections: 1) infection by close contact and 2) infection by touching surfaces. The infection risks are calculated on a trip segment basis. Different sources of data (such as smart card data, travel surveys, and population data) are used to estimate the potential interactions between the individual and the infectious environment. A first-order approximation is used to simplify the computational complexity. We also derive the closed-form formulation for the estimation errors, enabling us to quantify the uncertainty of the estimation results. The model is implemented in the MIT community as a case study. We evaluate the commute infection risks for employees and students. Results show that most of the individuals have an infection probability close to zero. The maximum infection probability is around 1.3%, implying that the probability of getting infected during the commuting process is low. Individuals with larger travel distances, traveling in transit, and traveling during peak hours are more likely to get infected. Practical implementations of the model are also discussed. © 2023",", COVID-19; Emerging mobility; Infection risk",English,Article,317,4,Mobility and Transportation

Therefore, this study proposes a novel tri-objective optimization model for routing and scheduling decisions within a ridesharing system, aiming to minimize the total travel time, the total carbon dioxide emissions produced throughout the transportation process, and the total delay in reaching the designated destination. A Multi-Objective Red Deer Algorithm is developed to find efficient Pareto solutions intelligently.

This paper uses an environmentally extended input-output approach to estimate the total greenhouse gas emissions consequent on inbound and domestic tourism trips in Wales, a region of the UK. We use the UN World Tourism Organisation (TSA) concept of visitors and trips to estimate the overall carbon footprint of tourism at around 3.4 megatons in 2019, 8.7% of total territorial emissions. We further compare these results with estimates for 2007 which suggests that there has been a modest reduction of under 2% per annum since 2007, but with significant data issues affecting comparability.

A central challenge in such services is the scheduling of rides. Classically, two versions of the problem have been explored: a static, when all ride requests are known in advance, and a dynamic, when ride requests arrive one by one.We explore a dynamic setting, but still assume that many users can plan their travel well in advance, increasing the potential for fleet-wide optimization. Knowledge of future trips in advance is one aspect of flexibility that the system leverages. The other aspect stems from the fact that often there is no need to travel at a specific time, rather a user may want to transport persons or goods to a given destination by some deadline and leave not earlier than a given threshold.The paper explores the engineering of a system that builds on an off-the-shelf optimization engine (OR-tools) and employs batching of requests while managing the adjustable scheduling and early commitment of advanced requests, balancing the user-oriented early commits and the efficiency of the fleet.

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) embodies a novel sustainable mobility paradigm and breathes fresh blood into mobility management. This work aims to reveal the potential acceptance of MaaS in the spectating context as well as the factors influencing the subscription of MaaS bundles, and to discuss the application of MaaS for mobility management at mega events. In the setting of the Hangzhou 2022 Asian Games, an online stated preference survey was conducted in mainland China regarding the entire travel process during the spectating period. Two mixed logit models were employed to analyze the choices of MaaS bundles in Airport/High-Speed Rail Station pick-up and drop-off (APD) scenario and Hotel-Venue (HV) scenario, respectively. Estimation results indicate that about 80% of the respondents are willing to subscribe to MaaS bundles and MaaS is capable of being used for mobility management. Household structure and income, as well as modality styles in daily and tourism, have significant impacts on the subscription intention of MaaS bundles. The results also show that respondents are sensitive to the subscription fees of MaaS bundles. Behavioral inertia is clearly demonstrated in the choice of APD MaaS bundles and obvious preference heterogeneity exists among respondents concerning the travel modes included in HV MaaS bundles. The findings from this study provide valuable information and strategies for transportation planners, event organizers, and those involved in the tourism sector. These insights can facilitate the implementation of personalized and sustainable smart mobility services during events or in tourism, enhancing the overall mobility experience. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Economics; Asian games; Case-studies; Effective mobilities; Hangzhou; Mega-event; Mixed logit; Mobility as a service; Mobility management; Sustainable transportation; Travel demand; Tourism, Mega-event; Mixed logit; Mobility as a Service; Mobility management; Sustainable transportation",English,Article,279,4,Mobility and Transportation

This concept also appears more and more often in modern cities, whose authorities strive to improve the quality of life of their inhabitants, among others by creating SUMP-Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. This is followed by all kinds of facilities that generate big traffic in cities. One of the institutions willing to meet the challenges of the ever-growing number of trips in its vicinity is Gdynia Maritime University (GMU), which is one of the largest employers in this seaport city, and thus – is one of the biggest traffic generators. The objective of this paper is to investigate the prerequisites and perspectives of creating and implementing mobility plan for GMU in order to make transport more sustainable in its vicinity. For this purpose, pilot research survey has been carried out among employees and students regarding their behaviour and transport preferences in reaching this destination. The research hypothesis stating that the transport habits of the GMU commuters are not compatible with the concept of sustainable mobility was confirmed. The implementation of a sustainable mobility plan in this institution will help to change the standards of traveling in the area of the University and will contribute to better quality of life in the city. It is recommended to enhance the cooperation with the Gdynia City Hall in order to create a synergy effect and bring an added value to sustainable development of this congested seaport urban space. © 2023, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

A proposal for smart villages implementation in the Madonie montains (Sicily),2023,"The Madonie district, in the inner Sicily, is composed of 21 villages, custodians of heritage, traditions, and values that constitute the identity of this area, now exclusively entrusted to the collective memory of an increasingly elderly and inactive population. In the study area, full of tangible and intangible heritage, technological tools, can revitalize and reuse examples of architecture, especially monumental, whose main problem is a deep rising damp affecting the masonry. That is particularly critical for the historic/traditional architectures. This research implements, in one of the villages of the enclave, a new technology system, namely Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tool, like Charge neutralisation Technology (CNT), in contrast to the usual application of the classic and well-known resolution systems. This kind of methodology has been already applied in many monumental buildings in Italy with brilliant results and supporting the protection, enhancement, and promotion of cultural heritage. In Sicily it was never used and represents, in line with the smart village approach, a viable technology to be applied. The smart village model is one of the increasingly popular research topics globally and provides technologies aimed at preserving the identity of the territory and the historical buildings. Culture, if usable and accessible to all, results as an economic resource, a tourist attraction, and a factor of identity. The goal is to develop these inner areas through the smart villages approach by implementing smart technologies and establishing a synergic union of centers to be more competitive in the Sicilian hinterland, but also at the national level, with respect to the wise use of administrative, political, and governmental strategies. Cultural heritage and innovation, together, retrace the past with a view to modernity. The country's cultural heritage recovered and enhanced is a virtuous strategy to safeguard the identity and value of historic places such as that one of ancient villages and a way to find smart resilient strategies and a sustainability assessment for future communities. © 2023 The Author(s)",", ICT approach; Smart rehabilitation; Smart strategies; Smart villages; Sustainable technology",English,Article,324,3,Urban Sustainability
35762695000; 57197846060,Interaction between islands and special economic zones: Spatial processes of containment and exclusion,2023,"Despite considerable research into special economic zones (SEZs) and Island Studies, islands and SEZs are rarely considered together. Islands and SEZs are, however, closely associated, in part due to the attractiveness of island characteristics (remoteness, boundedness, isolation) for exclusive economic processes. Many prominent SEZs are located on small islands, and many island economies function similarly to SEZs. Defining SEZs as ‘bounded spaces of economic and regulatory exception’, this paper considers deregulated industrial zones and exclusively branded smart cities and eco-cities, as well as island SEZs designed for external benefit and for local benefit. The study shows that spatial processes of containment and exclusion are supported by islands and are especially useful for crafting SEZs, which may specialise in industries such as financial services, manufacturing, gaming, port services and high-end tourism. Nevertheless, SEZ processes often create negative social, economic and environmental impacts. Island SEZs developed for external interest often seek to contain harm within islands or to exclude unfavourable factors, resulting in a spatial mismatch of harms and benefits. Island SEZs developed for local interest struggle to externalise harms, creating problems for island populations. The paper argues for the value of understanding islands and SEZs together, without exceptionalising them.

58742095600,Green tourism to green environment: unleashing green pro-tourism behavior for green tourism competitiveness in China,2023,"The aim of the study is to study the role of green pro-tourism behavior in developing green tourism competitiveness for green environment. Green tourism is on the rise in China, but locals are not getting on board with supporting it. This research recommends green human resource management (HRM) practices as a way to boost the competitiveness of green tourism and inspire citizens to adopt travel-friendly habits. Human resource management strategies that emphasize training, open lines of communication, and employee autonomy may help the tourism industry foster a culture of environmental stewardship that permeates the surrounding community. According to this study’s findings, sustainable tourism can be advanced through the promotion of green HRM practices, which encourage locals to take a more positive stance toward visitors and the destination as a whole. The environmental advantages of green HRM should also be well-researched. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate the connection between green HRM, P-EP, environmental consciousness, and servant leadership in the context of the tourism industry. This research used Smart PLS for its structural equation modeling, validity testing, and reliability analysis of data acquired from Chinese hotel workers. Green HRM was shown to have a good effect on proactive P-EP but a smaller effect on P-EP linked to tasks. In addition, the link between green HRM and task-related activities requires careful consideration of servant leadership as a moderating element. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Green environment; Green tourism; Green Tourism behavior; Tourism competitiveness, China; Habits; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Tourism; Travel; China; Competition; Personnel training; Reliability analysis; Resource allocation; Sustainable development; Tourism; China; Green environments; Green tourism; Green tourism behavior; Human resource management practices; Human resources management; Management strategies; Servant leadership; Tourism competitiveness; Tourism industry; competitiveness; ecotourism; green economy; human resource; leadership; reliability analysis; resource management; China; habit; human; reproducibility; tourism; travel; Human resource management",English,Retracted,245,11,Rural Resource Management
57222742036; 15127208300,Does tourism flow in cities drive green practices in the current smart city trajectories? Empirical evidence from Italy,2023,"Purpose: The concept of a smart city is becoming more closely linked to tourism destinations. The relationship between the environment, sustainability and tourism has become more interrelated. An eco-friendly city environment can influence tourists’ decisions, but tourist flows can also negatively impact the local ecosystem by increasing energy consumption, air pollution and environmental sustainability. In this research letter, the authors reverse this perspective, moving into smart city trajectories, highlighting that increasing tourism in cities drives the city to advance a green transition to respond to the imbalance generated by large flows of tourists that increase the users-density of the city. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the symbiotic relationship between increasing tourism in cities and the imperative for a green transition. Design/methodology/approach: This study builds on the generalized method of moment approach and an 11-year panel data set covering 30 Italian cities to investigate the relationship between tourism flow and the cities’ green practices embedded in the smart environment dimension. Findings: This study provides empirical evidence that a large flow of tourists in cities positively affects the cities’ green transition, contributing to the advancement of smart tourism and smart city debate. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses only on one country, and although its results may be generalizable to the European Union, it is not representative at a global level and requires further research. Practical implications: This study offers practical implications underscoring the benefits of large tourism inflow in managing and implementing smart city projects. Social implications: Tourism and overtourism may lead to a city reaction regarding green practices, which can have a multiplier benefit on the urban environment. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first study attempt to investigate the tourism flow as a driver of smart city implementation, considering the city’s reaction to tourism and overtourism conditions in the city that would lead to the ecological and sustainable collapse of a city. © 2023, International Tourism Studies Association.",", Green transition; Smart city; Smart environment; Sustainability; Tourism",English,Article,329,3,Urban Sustainability

Increased reliance on machine-made snow has implications for the sustainability of ski tourism. This study provides the first national estimate of water, energy, and CO2 emissions and projected changes under low (RCP2.6), mid (RCP4.5), and high emission (RCP8.5) climate futures by the 2050s. A central estimates of snowmaking efficiency found Canada currently uses 478,000 megawatts (MWh) of electricity (with 130,095 tonnes of associated CO2 emission) and 43.4 million m3 of water to produce over 42 million m3 of technical snow. With snowmaking production requirements projected to increase between 55% and 97% by 2050 across low to high-emission climate futures, energy, and water use will increase proportionally. In contrast, future emissions associated with increased snowmaking would nonetheless decline substantially as provincial electricity grids are decarbonized under current policy targets.

Based on China’s smart-city construction (SCC), a pilot program aimed at promoting applications of digital technologies in cities, this paper finds that SCC has led to a higher urban population growth in smart cities in China. Two potential channels are suggested by mechanism analysis: improved ecological environment resulting from digital governance with respect to pollution and green production; essential digital information provided by internet users. Specifically, relying on difference-in-differences analysis, the results reveal that, from 2005 to 2017, SCC in China led to approximately 4.4% higher urban population growth in smart cities relative to non-smart cities. In particular, evidence from migrant survey data suggests that smart cities are more favorable destinations for distant migrants, and migrants with higher educational attainment and income.

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) introduces the third dimension to intra-urban transport at a minimal infrastructure cost, bypassing congestion and providing reliable travel times to users through the provision of air passenger transportation. The performance of UAM systems is highly dependent on vertiport locations, vehicle sizing and infrastructure specifications, which themselves are intrinsically linked. This study takes a holistic approach to UAM network optimisation by considering the inter-relatedness of these decisions in a three-stage algorithm. In the first stage, a linear vertiport placement model with vehicle sizing constraints is developed to determine the optimal vertiport configuration while considering eVTOL performance. The vertiport configuration serves to determine the operational requirements of the aircraft and are incorporated in the vehicle sizing models. The resulting network configuration and vehicle sizing constraints are used as inputs in the infrastructure model, which utilises open network theory to determine the service rate requirements and the allowed loiter and waiting times based on the number of take-off, landing, and charging pads at each vertiport. These stages are executed sequentially through a feedback mechanism, which balances the infrastructure, operational costs as well as passenger waiting times. The algorithm optimises the profitability of the UAM network ensuring all operational constraints are satisfied. A case study based on the hypothetical implementation of UAM in the city of London is presented using Rolling Origin and Destination Survey data to estimate demand patterns. Our results suggest that ignoring vehicle sizing and infrastructure modelling in the network optimisation stage results in infeasible UAM networks. Furthermore, reducing waiting times and loiter times are critical to reduce operational costs of the UAM network, with all optimal configurations yielding waiting times below 5% of the total flight time. The proposed method can be used to plan future UAM developments whilst ensuring operational viability. © 2023 The Authors","England; London [England]; United Kingdom; air transportation; algorithm; transport structure; transport vehicle; travel demand; unmanned vehicle; urban transport, Queuing theory; Urban air mobility; Vehicle sizing; Vertiport placement",English,Article,321,4,Mobility and Transportation
58560484100,Harnessing renewable energy technologies for energy independence within Zimbabwean tourism industry: A pathway towards sustainability,2023,"Zimbabwe heavily relies on conventional energy sources, such as firewood, coal, thermal power, and hydropower, for meeting its energy needs. This research aims to explore the relationship between renewable energy technologies (RT), green tourism supply chain management (GTSCM), and energy independence in the context of Zimbabwe's tourism sector. Employing a quantitative methodology, data were gathered from 507 managers using stratified random sampling and the Krejcie and Morgan approach. Questionnaires were administered through Google Forms, and data analysis was performed using SMART PLS 3 software. The findings indicate direct significant relationship between renewable energy technologies (independent variable), green tourism supply chain management (mediator) and four dependent variables: energy grid resilience, energy self-sufficiency, energy capacity, energy access and efficiency. The T-statistics values for each of the nine direct hypotheses were all greater than the threshold of 1.96, ranging from a minimum of 2.765 to a maximum of 9.822. Furthermore, variance accounted for (VAR) analysis shows that green tourism supply chain management completely mediates the connection between renewable energy technologies and energy grid resilience (GR), explaining 64.1 % of the variance. Moreover, it has significant partial indirect impacts on other dependent variables like energy self-sufficiency (ES), energy capacity (EC), and energy access and efficiency (EA), accounting for 25.7 %, 20.4 %, and 42.1 % of the variance respectively. These results highlight how renewable energy technologies and GTSCM are crucial in shaping energy independence outcomes in Zimbabwe's tourism industry. The research proposes that adopting renewable energy technologies and practicing GTSCM can enhance energy independence and sustainability in the tourism supply chain. The significance of these findings provides useful guidance to policymakers and industry stakeholders, assisting them in formulating strategies that promote sustainable practices and achieve long-term energy independence objectives. © 2023 International Energy Initiative","Energy access and efficiency; Energy capacity; Energy grid resilience; Energy independence; Energy self-sufficiency; Green tourism supply chain management; Renewable energy technologies, Zimbabwe; Sustainable development; Energy access; Energy access and efficiency; Energy grid resilience; Energy grids; Energy independence; Energy self-sufficiency; Energy-capacity; Green tourism supply chain management; Renewable energy technologies; Tourism supply chain; alternative energy; energy efficiency; software; supply chain management; sustainability; tourism economics; Supply chain management",English,Article,290,11,Rural Resource Management

Every GCC nation has its own urban planning authority to manage urban growth and development since its independence from British rule. These planning agencies create strategies, plans, rules, and oversee the building process. The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive analysis, cross-border comparisons, and the generation of insights that contribute to a deeper understanding of urban planning dynamics and strategies within the Gulf Cooperation Council. The objective of this article is to examine the national spatial strategies (NSS) and vision plans of GCC countries. This study discusses the existing methods, plans, and efforts to accomplish this goal while emphasizing prospective opportunities, problems, and difficulties. We used the SWOT method to evaluate the national vision plans of GCC countries. The analysis identifies successful outcomes that the GCC countries have already achieved in terms of their national spatial strategies. The weakness in the current strategies is oil dependency, which could be strengthened. Potential opportunities in the tourism sector need to be taken full advantage of, and potential threats, like regional tension, need to be managed to prevent the failure of the development of the existing urban system. The primary suggestion entails executing programs outlined by the respective line ministries and ensuring efficient management of urban spatial expansion by municipal authorities. However, the findings could serve as lessons for those at the helm of affairs in GCC countries to collaborate and achieve a comprehensive national strategic plan. © 2023 by the authors.","GCC; national spatial strategy; SWOT; vision plan, growth and development; strategic approach; urban growth; urban planning; urban policy",English,Article,257,11,Rural Resource Management

This study further contributes to the measurement of activity-based social segregation between multiple groups using public transport smart card data. In particular, social segregation is quantified using the ordinal information theory index to measure the income group mix at public transport journey destination zones. The method is applied to the public transport smart card data of Stockholm County, Sweden. Applying the index on 2017–2020 data sets for a selected week, shows significant differences between income groups’ segregation along the radial public transport corridors following the opening of a major rail project in the summer of 2017. The overall slight decrease in segregation over the years can be linked to declining segregation in the city center as a travel destination and its public transport hubs.

The conservation of the non-tangible part includes signs and symbols. It transmits in various ways, like oral, artistic, and literary forms of expression. The visitor of historical places can participate in non-tangible conservation if the architect makes the visitor attracted to the sites. To make the visitor see the values of the sites, the visitor should move to different parts in different directions instead of seeing a few buildings and monuments. The study aims to increase visitor activity to promote non-physical conservation. Many places like Koya city have a very high architectural value but it is still neglected and uncovered by visitors. Researchers made observations to demonstrate the general characteristics of the district, then designed a questionnaire to collect the required data, specifying the locations they mostly visit, determining the paths they have taken, defining the areas visitors rarely visit, and alleys they do not go through for various reasons, gradually becoming a neglected place. Finally, the study conducted space syntax analysis based on pedestrian movement to reshape the visitor's movement. Based on the findings, the study will design strategies to enhance tourist movement and conserve non-tangibles. © 2023 The Authors.

In this paper, we develop a generative adversarial machine learning network to characterize the temporal and spatial mobility behavior of public transit passengers, based on massive smart card data and road network data. The Apriori algorithm is extended with spatio-temporal constraints to extract frequent transit mobility patterns of individual passengers based on a reconstructed personal trip dataset. This individual-level pattern information is used to construct personalized feature vectors. For regular and frequent public transit passengers, we identify similar transit mobility groups using spatio-temporal constraints to construct a group feature vector. We develop a generative adversarial network to embed public transit mobility of passengers. The proposed model’s generator consists of an auto-encoder, which extracts a low-dimensional and compact representation of passenger behavior, and a pre-trained sub-generator containing generalization features of public transit passengers. Shenzhen City is taken as the study area in this paper, and experiments were carried out based on smart card data, road network data, and bus GPS data. Clustering analysis of embedding vector representation and estimation of the top K transit destinations were conducted, verifying that the proposed method can profile passenger transit mobility in a comprehensive and compact manner. © 2023 by the authors.",", generative adversarial network; public transit; smart card data; transit mobility embedding",English,Article,237,4,Mobility and Transportation

Nevertheless, the safety of micromobility users, particularly cyclists, remains a concern in urban environments. This study aims to construct a safety map and a risk-averse routing system for micromobility users in diverse urban environments, as exemplified by a case study in Lisbon. A data-driven methodology uses object detection algorithms and image segmentation techniques to identify potential risk factors on cycling routes from Google Street View images. The ‘Bikeable’ Multilayer Perceptron neural network measures these risks, assigning safety scores to each image. The method analyzed 5321 points across 24 parishes in Lisbon, with an average safety score of 4.5, indicating a generally safe environment for cyclists. Carnide emerged as the safest area, while Alcântara exhibited a higher level of potential risks. Additionally, an equation is proposed to compute route efficiency, enabling comparisons between different routes for identical origin-destination pairs. Preliminary findings suggest that the presented routing solution exhibits higher efficiency than the commercial routing benchmark. Risk-averse routes did not result in a substantial rise in travel distance or time, with increments of 7% on average. The study also contributed to increasing the existing amount of cycle path data in Lisbon by 12%, correcting inaccuracies, and updating the network in OpenStreetMap, providing access to more precise information and, consequently, more routes. The key contributions of this study, such as the safety map and risk-averse router, underscore the potential of data-driven tools for boosting urban micromobility. The solutions proposed demonstrate modularity and adaptability, making them fit for a range of urban scenarios and highlighting their value for cities prioritizing safe, sustainable urban mobility. © 2023 by the authors.",", cycling; image segmentation; micromobility; mobility; object detection; route optimization; safety assessment; sustainability; urban transport",English,Article,279,4,Mobility and Transportation

58290084400,The smart city and COVID-19,2023,"Smart cities are concepts much loved by politicians and technologists but are very difficult to bring about in practice. There are many isolated applications in cities such as operating streetlamps, but very few, if any, examples of integrated applications sharing data and managing the city as a holistic entity rather than a set of disparate and unconnected applications. This is despite hundreds of trials and indicates how difficult bringing about a smart city will be. The key challenge is the wide range of interested parties in a city including the elected city authority, subcontractors and suppliers to the authority, emergency services, transport providers, businesses, residents, workers, tourists, and other visitors. Some of these entities will be primarily driven by finance, such as businesses and transport providers. Some will be driven by political considerations. Some will be concerned with the quality of life as well as financial costs. In some cases, there will be conflicting interests-the city may want as much information as possible on people in the city, whereas individuals may want privacy and the minimum data stored concerning their movements and attributes. COVID-19 does not change any of these issues, but it does increase the importance of some applications such as smart health, logistics, people surveillance, data security, and crisis management, while reducing the importance of others such as traffic management. It may result in more willingness for monitoring and data sharing if this can be shown to result in better control of the virus. © 2023 the authors.",", Centralised data storage; City governance; COVID-19; IoT; Smart city; Smart healthcare; Smart logistics; Trials",English,Book chapter,250,3,Urban Sustainability

The results show the following: First, after experiencing the four stages of the independent stage in the urban-rural isolation period, output stage in the rural-support urban period, compensatory stage in the urban-feeding rural period, and modern agriculture stage in the urban-rural integration period, the new stage of urban-rural, high-quality integrated urban agriculture indicates the four new characteristics of new functions, new technologies, new mechanisms, and new forms. Second, based on the concepts of the four new characteristics of urban agriculture in the new stage, the development of urban agriculture in Guangzhou can be summarized by the four basic patterns of stereoscopic agriculture (new form), leisure agriculture (new function), rural complex (new technology), and shared agriculture (new mechanism) distributed from the central to outside region. Stereoscopic agriculture, which is basically located in the CBD, combines agriculture and commercial functions, focusing on new technologies such as e-commerce operations and technological displays, emphasizing the characteristics of commercial operations in the mechanism, and manifesting itself as an intensive three-dimensional construction. Leisure agriculture, essentially located in the urban central area, is the combination of agriculture and the daily recreation function of citizens. It applies park landscape construction and artistic creation techniques, revealing the characteristics of the farming experience and providing leisure parks for citizens. The rural complex is basically located in the inner suburban area and combines agricultural production with scientific research activities. It comprehensively uses new technologies of farmland consolidation and agricultural production and is characterized by science, technology, and agriculture shaped as independent islands. In the outer suburbs, shared agriculture combines traditional agricultural production with the rural tourism experience, in addition to using new agricultural technologies for farmland preparation and production. It also emphasizes using new Internet of Things technologies, highlighting the new mechanism of shared participation, and is designed as standardized farmland. Third, the innovative experience of Guangzhou's urban agriculture development mainly includes strengthening the transformation of agricultural resources and the value of multiple functions; diversified innovation and integration forms; pattern innovation, new technologies, and artificial intelligence to enhance the development of urban agriculture; the combined mechanism of ""government, enterprise, and university""; and institutional guarantees to facilitate the implementation of urban agriculture projects.

It provides useful insights for tourism authorities and policymakers in designing a smart tourist card that meets the needs of tourists while preserving and supporting areas’ wellbeing. Taking Thessaloniki city as a case study, a tourist survey, designed based on the key features of European destination cards, was implemented to identify needs and motivations. Interesting insight was revealed: tourists want to self-explore the city, are coming with their families, are history-lovers and gastronomy-keen, and are strongly willing to be provided with a destination card offering unlimited access to public transport. The latter reveals an opportunity for the city; the tourists are willing to use sustainable mobility options, which means that a base of sustainable travelling exists. The proposed Thessaloniki smart card can bring together tourists’ needs with the city’s sustainability goals; the development of tourist packages, including sustainable mobility provisions, walking-talking tours, and bike rentals, should be the backbone of the card. The next challenge for the city is to build a cooperation network to support this smart destination card implementation and promotion. © 2023 by the authors.","Central Macedonia; Greece; Thessaloniki [Central Macedonia]; Thessaloniki [Thessaloniki (DPR)]; ecotourism; public transport; surveying; Sustainable Development Goal; tourist destination, destination cards; sustainability; tourism; tourists’ needs",English,Article,192,3,Urban Sustainability

As a critical transportation mode in cities, public transit was hit hardest. In this study, we analyze public transit usage of urban visitors with a nearly two-year smart card dataset collected in Jeju, South Korea – a major tourism city in the Asia Pacific. The dataset captures transit usage behavior of millions of domestic visitors who traveled to Jeju between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020. By identifying a few key pandemic stages based on COVID-19 timeline, we employ ridge regression models to investigate the impact of pandemic severity on transit ridership. We then derive a set of mobility indicators – from perspectives of trip frequency, spatial diversity, and travel range – to quantify how individual visitors used the transit system during their stay in Jeju. By further employing time series decomposition, we extract the trend component for each mobility indicator to study long-term dynamics of visitors’ mobility behavior. According to the regression analysis, the pandemic had a dampening effect on public transit ridership. The overall ridership was jointly affected by national and local pandemic situations. The time series decomposition result reveals a long-term decay of individual transit usage, hinting that visitors in Jeju tended to use the transit system more conservatively as the pandemic endured. The study provides critical insights into urban visitors’ transit usage behavior during the pandemic and sheds light on how to restore tourism, public transit usage, and overall urban vibrancy with some policy suggestions. © 2023 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies",", COVID-19; Public transit; Smart card data; Tourism; Travel behavior",English,Article,258,4,Mobility and Transportation

This study analyzed how these efforts have changed the nature of neighborhood identity in Yanglim, Gwangju, Korea. The authors analyzed 62,386 Naver blog posts from 2013 to 2022, utilizing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, Topic Modeling (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Using trend analysis by topic, three phases were identified: (1) Phase 1: Flourishment (January 2013 to October 2016); (2) Phase 2: Maturation (November 2016 to February 2020); and (3) Phase 3: COVID-19 (March 2020 to October 2022). In the first phase, the collective actions between the local government and citizens to improve the declined neighborhood formed the Yanglim area’s reputation as the “History and Cultural Village” and as “Penguin Village”. The unique identity of the area in the second phase, along with gentrification issues, created a hot spot (e.g., cafés and restaurants), drawing the attention of tourists and locals. More recently, the Yanglim area has become a place for locals’ daily activities with their loved ones, as tourist traffic greatly dropped off due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Until now, the Yanglim area has experienced a process of successful urban regeneration from flourishment to degentrification.

The smart city and smart tourist destination approaches are aimed at improving efficiency in management, the quality of life of the residents and the tourist experiences. However, little is known about how these ideas are being translated into real policies and whether they are having a real impact. The objective of this paper is to understand how the smart approach is being deployed in the planning processes of Spanish tourist cities and destinations, and its implications in terms of the governance, sustainability and data-driven public management. The planning instruments that guide the smart strategies of different Spanish cities are identified and analysed. This is complemented with a questionnaire administered among managers of the smart city and smart destination initiatives. The findings reveal the diversity of smart initiatives, their benefits and limitations. The results contribute to generating a necessary debate on the implications of the smart discourse for urban and tourism planning and enrich the international debate around this approach. © 2023 The Authors","Smart cities; Smart destinations; Smart tourism; Tourism planning; Urban planning, Spain; smart city; technological development; tourism; tourism management; tourist destination; urban planning",English,Article,198,3,Urban Sustainability

The Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) is one of the world’s most utilised protected and conserved area management tools, used to inform research, tourism management, natural resources use, intelligence, threat analyses, and more. Through surveying staff at 49 protected and conserved areas across 14 countries, we examine how SMART is being implemented in terms of eight key factors in data management and decision-making. Results indicate room for improvement in all aspects of the adaptive process, particularly relating to the planning of systematic patrols as well as the role of management in the adaptive process. Additionally, many sites provide low levels of training and suffer from insufficient staffing.

These changes have strongly impacted the interaction between service supply and demand in the transport industry. In this context, passive data as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth become a key source of information to understand individual mobility behaviors and ensure the sustainable development of transport infrastructures. In this paper, we present a framework that uses disruptive technology to collect passive data in buses, continuously and at a lower cost than traditional mobility surveys. Previous research, conducted over a more limited spatial and temporal framework, uses filtering methods, which do not allow the results to be replicated. This study uses artificial intelligence to sort transmitted signals, get transit ridership and build Origin–Destination matrices. Its originality consists in providing a concrete, automatic and replicable method to transport operators. The comparison of the results with other data sources confirms the relevance of the presented algorithms in demand forecasting. Therefore, our findings provide interesting insights for data-driven decision making and service quality management in urban public transport. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Clustering algorithm; Origin–Destination matrices; Passive data analytics; Public transport demand; Travel behavior; Wi-Fi sensors, Data Analytics; Decision making; Economics; Matrix algebra; Urban transportation; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Data analytics; Origin destination matrices; Passive data analytic; Public transport; Public transport demand; Socio-economic transformations; Transport demand; Travel behaviour; Urban areas; Wi-fi sensor; algorithm; bus transport; cluster analysis; decadal variation; mobility; public transport; transportation development; travel demand; Clustering algorithms",English,Article,198,4,Mobility and Transportation

It strengthens “social foundations” and creates sustainable values through its multiplier effects and interconnectedness with Sustainable Development Goals. Equally important are tourism’s environmental impacts, carbon footprints, and greenhouse gas emissions, which are likely to exacerbate by rising global tourism and unending demands for materials, resources, and products. Thus, the prevalent ‘business as usual’ production approach is widely questioned, and decoupling the socioeconomic development from environmental impacts is emphasized to lay down the basis of sustainable and smart green tourism by applying circular economy principles in tourism. The coronavirus, though it was an irreparable disaster for tourism, gave an opportunity to rebuild it on circular economy principles. This paper explored the interlinkages between the circular economy and the tourism industry from the perspective of building a circular ecosystem in tourism, given its interdependence and interconnectedness. The approach followed is qualitative and exploratory, and reviews the available literature, which is fragmented and scattered. It brings out that deep interlinkages exist between the circular economy and travel and tourism; and the circular economy principles’ application (6Rs-refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, recycle) in tourism can contribute substantially towards resilient tourism ecosystem and social and economic progress through reduced consumption of primary energy sources and materials. The practical and theoretical implications are clearly visible to all stakeholders, including managers, policymakers, and organizations. Managers face a challenge to find ways and means to initiate a transition to a circular economy in tourism to bring down the circularity gap. Since this study is not sector-specific and assumes the availability of technical abilities, engineering skills, government policies, and institutional structures for products and services, etc., these areas can be taken up as future research areas. © 2023, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Mobilities and social gaps in Barcelona",2023,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a critical framework to analyse how “smart” plays out in tourism places. Moving from a recognition of the strategies, expected impacts and imageries of Smart City, the authors engage with the mobilities literature to identify pitfalls in the quest of “smartening up” cities for hypermobile populations. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a set of geoanalytical techniques to establish the potential relationship between the territorial upgrade of mobility and the socio-economic change processes the city of Barcelona is experiencing. Findings: The paper suggests the effect of “smart” in cities could indeed be one of economic recovery; however, one triggering fundamental transformation of the social fabric of the city, whose most evident facet is the creation of globalised functional enclaves that may be forcefields of exclusion for the most vulnerable populations. Originality/value: This paper contributes to a new stream of critical research on “smart” with a strong focus on the power of mobilities and mobility systems, whose digital enhancement plays out as a leveraging agent of new place connections and negotiations for short-term populations, but at the same time, may exclude disadvantaged subjects in their capacity to access and afford the system network. © 2023, Fiammetta Brandajs and Antonio Paolo Russo.",", Agency; Mobility injustice; Smart cities; Socio-demographic change; Tourism mobilities",English,Article,207,3,Urban Sustainability

It is significant to explore the development and evolution trend of residential carbon emissions research for mitigating global climate change. However, there have been no studies that comprehensively review this research field. Based on the research papers on residential carbon emissions included in the Web of Science core database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, the CiteSpace bibliometric analysis software was used in this paper to draw the visual knowledge map of residential carbon emissions research and reveal its research status, research hotspots, and development trend. We found that residential carbon emissions research has gone through the stage of “emergence–initiation–rapid development”, and the research in the United States and the United Kingdom has played a fundamental role in developing this research field. Research hotspots mainly focus on analyzing energy demand, quantitative measurement, and impact mechanisms of residents’ direct and indirect carbon emissions and low-carbon consumption willingness. The focus of research has gradually shifted from qualitative analysis based on relevant policies to the analysis of quantitative spatiotemporal measurements and drive mechanisms of direct and indirect carbon emissions from residential buildings, transportation, and tourism based on mathematical models and geographic information system technologies. Modern intelligent means such as remote sensing technology and artificial intelligence technology can improve the dynamics and accuracy of this research, but there are few related types of research at present. Based on these research status and trends, we proposed that the future research direction of residential carbon emissions should focus more on spatial analysis and trend prediction based on intelligent methods under a low-carbon background. © 2023 by the authors.","Artificial Intelligence; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Software; China; United Kingdom; United States; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; GIS; literature review; policy analysis; research work; residential location; software; spatiotemporal analysis; accuracy; analysis; artificial intelligence; bibliometrics; carbon emission; China; climate change; cluster analysis; energy consumption; energy demand; geographic information system; government; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; greenhouse gas emission; health care policy; hotspot analysis; household; human; industrialization; mathematical model; medical research; municipal solid waste; prediction; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; residential carbon emission; Review; solid waste management; spatial analysis; tourism; traffic and transport; trend study; United Kingdom; United States; artificial intelligence; software, carbon emissions; CiteSpace; literature review; resident consumption; residential carbon emissions",English,Review,278,11,Rural Resource Management

In this case study, an interdisciplinary research team describes the process of refining and evaluating the utility of a transportation daily diary mobile-phone-based app. The process is framed through transportation equity and diverse key stakeholder engagement. The team custom-designed the app, MyAmble, to capture successful transportation behaviors, as well as latent demand, defined as travel not taken but desired, among underserved populations. Stakeholder focus groups with subject matter expert (n = 30) and end users (n = 19) were conducted prior to pilot testing the app, and post-pilot test focus groups (n = 18) and usability surveys (n = 76) were conducted to evaluate the app's usability. Pre-pilot focus groups indicated that transportation planners desired more questions about safety and other transit modes. End users identified missing destinations, such as temporary housing locations. Post-pilot focus group members reported that using MyAmble required minimal training or technological assistance and that they had sustained confidence throughout usage. Further refinements include reducing length of daily use and resolving Broadband or data plan obstacles for end users. Designing transportation apps to collect data about transportation behaviors among underserved population members is critical to equitable transportation planning. Moreover, key stakeholder involvement in the design may produce more successful apps and those which include more relevant information for planners, as well as more inclusive travel behaviors. © 2023 The Author(s)",", Mobile transportation daily diary; Stakeholder engagement; Transportation equity",English,Article,251,4,Mobility and Transportation
55533821200,Public Policies for Territorial Cohesion and Sustainability in Europe: An Overview,2023,"This paper provides an analysis of public policies for territorial cohesion and sustainability in Europe, using a conceptual framework that takes into account theoretical approaches and empirical studies. Three case studies were examined, including the Tâmega e Sousa region in Portugal, the Jaén region in Spain, and the Province of Avellino in Italy. The analysis revealed similarities and differences between these territories in terms of the effectiveness of public policies for territorial cohesion and sustainability. Positive points included the creation of networks and partnerships, the use of smart specialization strategies, and the promotion of sustainable tourism. Negative points included a lack of coordination between different levels of government, insufficient investment in infrastructure, and a lack of awareness of the potential benefits of sustainability. Based on these findings, the paper suggests several recommendations for public policies and research on territorial cohesion and sustainability. These include the need for greater collaboration between different levels of government and stakeholders, increased investment in infrastructure and innovation, and the development of more sustainable tourism strategies. Overall, this paper highlights the importance of public policies for territorial cohesion and sustainability in promoting economic development, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability in Europe. © 2023 by the author.","Europe; conceptual framework; ecotourism; European Union; regional development; social policy; strategic approach; sustainability, European Union; public policies; regional development; sustainability; territorial cohesion",English,Article,200,11,Rural Resource Management

The popularity of travel route development has resulted in tourists using cities’ infrastructure to enable travel from areas with well-structured accessibility to more inaccessible areas. Despite the importance of the accessibility of travel routes to enhance travel experiences, the tourism literature lacks an understanding of how travel routes should consider not only the physical distance between tourist destinations but also accessibility using mobility within smart tourism cities. Therefore, this research aims to examine the importance of considering accessibility in assessing a travel route. Drawing on the distance decay theory and the concept of the effective tourism exclusion zone (ETEZ), we argue that a travel route can be adopted when every part of the route is accessible in terms of time cost. To achieve the objective, this research adopted a multi-method approach. We explored how much developers consider accessibility when generating a travel route via a case study in study 1. An experiment, study 2, strengthened the results of study 1, presenting cause-and-effect relationships.

This study aims to investigate the dynamic effects of economic growth, renewable energy use, urbanization, industrialization, tourism, agricultural productivity, and forest area on CO2 emissions in Thailand. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach and the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) methodology were used to analyze time series data from 1990 to 2020. According to the estimates, a 1% rise in economic growth, urbanization, industrialization, and tourism will raise CO2 emissions by 0.97%, 0.17%, 0.06%, and 0.05%, respectively. Furthermore, a 1% increase in renewable energy use, agricultural productivity, and forest area may result in reductions in CO2 emissions of 0.71%, 0.22%, and 0.69%, respectively. This article makes policy recommendations on low-carbon economies, renewable energy use, sustainable urbanization, green industrialization, eco-friendly tourism, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable forest management, all of which could help ensure environmental sustainability by lowering emissions. Furthermore, the findings of the study may guide other developing nations seeking to implement effective environmental sustainability approaches while also increasing climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Highlights: • This study investigated the nexus between environmental factors and carbon emissions. • Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares method has been applied by utilizing time series data. • Carbon emissions rise with economic growth, urbanization, industry, and tourism. • Renewable energy, agriculture, and forests showed emission reduction potential. • This article recommends sustainable development and emission reduction policies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission reduction; Environment; Renewables; Sustainability, Thailand; Abstracting; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Forestry; Least squares approximations; Sustainable development; Time series; Carbon emissions; CO 2 emission; Economic growths; Emission reduction; Environment; Environmental factors; Industrialisation; Renewable energy use; Renewables; Thailand; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental factor; sustainability; sustainable development; tourist destination; Carbon dioxide",English,Article,264,11,Rural Resource Management

Since the tourism and hospitality industry is subject to environmental expectations from visitors, governments, and the community, it is vital to understand what motivates GMPs to overcome environmental obstacles and satisfy those demands. However, the current literature fails to comprehensively justify how small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) tackle green management difficulties when implementing their plans, even though these SMEs could be a leading contributor to environmental concerns. Although many scholars assert that employees’ pro-environmental behaviours are decisive in boosting efforts of green management to improve corporate sustainable performance, only limited studies probed the importance of employees’ pro-environmental behaviours in SMEs in developing countries. To fill this research gap, the data was gathered from 304 small- and medium-sized hotels and travel agency middle managers using a self-administered survey approach. The collected data was analysed using the Smart PLS-structural equation modelling technique. The PLS-SEM results demonstrated that GMPs can improve environmental, economic, and social performance and these relationships can be strengthened through the moderating effects of employees’ pro-environmental behaviour. The study findings revealed that small- and medium-sized hospitality businesses should focus on creating a culture of environmental stewardship and actively involve employees in green initiatives to enhance sustainable performance. The study is important as it helps to understand the role of employee pro-environmental behaviour in green management and sustainable performance in small- and medium-sized hospitality businesses and can help the industry to adopt more sustainable practices.

Mass rapid transit (MRT) is especially important for large cities, such as Taipei City, Taiwan. In particular, MRT aims to improve mobility and reliability, but has limitations in providing first and last mile accessibility to final destinations or origins. Taipei City, Taiwan has introduced a public bike sharing scheme to service this gap. However, few studies have addressed how a public bike sharing scheme assists first and last mile accessibility. This study uses Taipei City as a case study to investigate this issue by comparing the demand and supply of the public bike sharing scheme, YouBike, at a detailed spatial scale. The supply of YouBike is represented by the time saving compared to walking for each identified origin and destination pair in the study area (i.e., Point of Interests (POIs) and MRT stations). The demand for YouBike is total trips from each YouBike station to a MRT station using public transport smart card data. By comparing the demand and supply for over 400 zones or villages, service gaps and areas of unbalanced service can be identified. The results show that YouBike does provide first and last mile service for the MRT network with some evidence of service mismatch in the study area, i.e., high service for low demand and vice versa.

In the context of resilience, a smart tourism city could be a solution for enhancing community resilience. Thus, it is important to identify available community resources to help people cope with adversity, which can contribute to the overriding goal of a smart tourism city. To do this, we aim to provide empirical evidence on the spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters as community resources on community resilience to advance the building of a resilient smart tourism city. Using spatial econometric modeling with spatial data, we measure the spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters on community resilience in the United States. The findings reveal the significant spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters on community resilience within a specific region and across surrounding regions. The findings of this study provide policymakers and practitioners with spatial information on regional sport industry clusters as community resources that are locally bound and specialize in smart tourism and planning to enhance community resilience. © 2023",", Sports; Adaptive capabilities; Adverse events; Community resiliences; Community resources; Industry clusters; Socio-economic conditions; Spatial data; Spatial econometric models; Spillover effects; Sports industries; Tourism",English,Article,194,11,Rural Resource Management

Digital technologies have reshaped the smart city paradigm in terms of both resilience and sustainability, capitalizing cities’ cultural and historical components while providing unique potential for growth in the real estate industry. Real estate, in particular, is considered a main asset to the tourist experience, whether it is in the form of hospitality accommodation facilities, urban landscapes, or cultural heritage hotspots. In addition, the effect of cultural sites and overall destination attractiveness on real estate dynamics (land/housing prices and building activity) is well established. Thus, uncovering how enhanced technological throughputs and synergies, culture-led urban sustainability initiatives and the real estate dimension are directly (or indirectly) associated could support cities to better delineate policies for their promotion as international, sustainable, and resilient tourist destinations. With this perspective, the present study focused on four particular cities’ successful smart initiatives, namely Amsterdam, Barcelona, Seoul, and Stockholm, in an attempt to identify how developers and local authorities will need to transform in order to offer better services to residents and visitors. This work reveals that smart projects alone cannot secure the transition of existing (European) cities into smart and sustainable tourism destinations. In addition, this study also contributes to public policy by demonstrating how challenging it is to be smart without the support and involvement of the local community, highlighting the significance of public awareness. The empirical findings suggest that local authorities are of critical importance when shaping a well-structured and practically effective strategy for the integration of sustainable and technologically advanced smart features. Results are promising, and final reflections provide insights for tourism destinations policymakers, city authorities, and real estate professionals. © 2023 by the authors.","Amsterdam [North Holland]; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Netherlands; North Holland; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Spain; building construction; cultural heritage; ecotourism; resilience; smart city; sustainability; tourism development, circular economy; cultural heritage; innovation systems; intelligent regions; local growth; real estate; regional cities; regional policies; smart cities; urban sustainability",English,Article,285,3,Urban Sustainability

Consequently, reducing emissions and improving environmental conditions are now a global priority for promoting sustainable growth and preventing the adverse consequences of global warming and climate change. However, there is a paucity of research employing econometric methodologies to investigate the potential of emission reduction factors, particularly in the case of the Philippines. Thus, the present study explored the dynamic effects of economic growth, renewable energy use, urbanization, industrialization, tourism, agricultural productivity, and forest area in the Philippines in order to accomplish environmental sustainability by lowering CO2 emissions. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach and the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) methodology were used to scrutinize time series yearly data from 1990 to 2020.

Furthermore, a 1% increase in renewable energy consumption, agricultural productivity, and forest area may result in CO2 emissions reductions of 1.50%, 0.20%, and 3.46%, respectively. Furthermore, the pairwise Granger causality test was employed to capture the causal relationships between the variables. This article provides policy implications on low-carbon economies, promoting renewable energy use, sustainable urbanization, green industrialization, eco-friendly tourism, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable forest management, all of which could help ensure environmental sustainability by lowering emissions. © 2023 The Author(s)",", Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission reduction; Environment; Renewable energy; Sustainability",English,Article,248,11,Rural Resource Management

First, the development options related to low-carbon tourism in rural areas are discussed. Then, a low-carbon rural slow tourism recommendation method based on AI and a low-carbon rural tourism scene recognition method based on Cross-Media Retrieval (CMR) data are proposed. Finally, the proposed scheme is tested. The test results show that the carbon dioxide emissions of one-day tourism projects account for less than 10% of the total tourism industry. From the proportion, it is found that air transport accounts for the largest proportion, more than 40%. With the development of time, the number of rural slow tourists in Guizhou has increased the most, while the number of rural slow tourists in Yunnan has increased to a lesser extent. In the K-means clustering model, the accuracy of scenario classification based on the semantic features of scene attributes is 5.26% higher than that of attribute likelihood vectors. On the Support Vector Machine classifier, the scene classification accuracy based on the semantic features of scene attributes is 19.2% higher than that of the scene classification based on attribute likelihood vector features. CMR techniques have also played a satisfying role in identifying rural tourism scenarios. They enable passengers to quickly identify tourist attractions to save preparation time and provide more flexible time for the tour process. The research results have made certain contributions to the sustainable development of low-carbon rural slow tourism. © 2023 by the authors.","China; Guizhou; Yunnan; artificial intelligence; carbon dioxide; recognition; sustainable development; tourism; visualization, artificial intelligence; Cross-Media Retrieval technology; low-carbon villages; scenario recognition; slow tourism; sustainable development; visualization",English,Article,275,11,Rural Resource Management

This study aims to establish a fire risk assessment system and model to assess fire safety for heritage villages. Given the complexity and openness of the heritage village system, the nonlinearity of the driving factors, and the dual attributes of residence and tourism, this paper constructs an index system of three aspects: cultural relic value sensitivity, village fire hazard, and evacuation accessibility. Based on ANP and the Bayes algorithm, a hybrid intelligent model is developed, and the index is weighted by combining subjective expert scoring and objective fact statistics. Finally, ArcGIS buffer and network analysis functions are used for grid processing to quantify and evaluate the difference in fire risk distribution in spatial units of heritage villages. We apply this assessment method to Chengkan Village, a national critical cultural relic protection unit. The results reveal that the cluster settlement layout pattern of the ancestral temple buildings plays a decisive role in the fire risk distribution in Chengkan Village; furthermore, the main factors leading to fire risk were analyzed. In Chengkan Village’s core area, the focus of the local government should be on strengthening active fire prevention measures to reduce the probability of fire. In contrast, in the northern and southern areas, it should focus on enhancing passive fire prevention measures to reduce the possibility of significant fires. © 2023 by the authors.",", brick–timber structure; fire assessment; fire hazard; heritage village",English,Article,235,11,Rural Resource Management

However, the globe has tried to introduce several initiatives to fight for environmental sustainability, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. The leading role of the proposed goals is to balance development and environmental anxiety. Therefore, to these issues, artificial intelligence and technological advancements play a vital role in the natural resource economy in the digital age. Policy analysts are always looking for solutions and have come up with several viable remedies to this problem. Consequently, information & communication technology (ICT) plays a significant role in sustainability in the digital era. However, under the theme of natural resource sustainability, the effectiveness of ICT has a significant impact on sustainability. Accordingly, the current study investigates the long-run effect of income per capita, tourism, natural resources rents, urbanization, and ICT on environmental sustainability in 36 OECD economies from 2000 to 2018. The current research employs an Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and two-step GMM to investigate the study's objectives. Results show the positive contribution of urbanization, natural resources, and tourism to CO2 emissions, while ICT reduces emissions. Besides, an inverted EKC curve is also validated for selected economies. In addition, the moderate effect of ICT on urbanization, natural resources, and tourism shows a significant decline in CO2 emissions.

European countries have already started moving toward realizing this innovative transportation system. However, advancement in global transport with longer distances is rare and needs more infrastructural preparation and studies to clarify the steps for such a transition. In this paper, an advanced intermodal service network model (AI-SNM) is proposed to support the development of synchromodal transportation systems. This mixed-integer programming (MIP) model finds the optimal path between O/D pairs while considering horizontal integration of variant transport modes in a supply chain network along with resource constraints and time windows. It minimizes the total transportation cost, transshipment cost, and tardiness with a penalty for delays at intermodal terminals and overdue costs at the destination that accounts for the opening and closing times of the terminals. In order to solve the model for large problem instances, an efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm using a novel coding approach is developed. The algorithm is tested on two US-based case studies, showing the capability of the model to provide cost- and time-saving advantages in long-haul freight. The results of this study can be applied to long-distance global transportation with similar geography and scale. © 2022",", Genetic Algorithm; Intermodal; Metaheuristic; Multi-mode; Operation Research; Optimization; Routing; Scheduling; Service Network Design; Synchromodal Transport",English,Article,212,4,Mobility and Transportation

Mismanagement of natural resources is thought to be essential in growing natural resource curse and, as a result, decreasing the value addition of sustainable products, contributing to unsustainable development. Artificial intelligence, along with other factors, has emerged as a major driver of output and value addition. The present study investigates the asymmetric role of artificial intelligence and natural resource management on sustainable export value embedment over the period 1980–2020 for China's economy using the Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model. The results of the study validate the asymmetric association between artificial intelligence and sustainable export value addition. Similarly, an asymmetric relationship exists between natural resource management and the value of sustainable export. Further, the dynamic multiplier analysis advocates that the effect of negative shock in artificial intelligence is dominant whereas the impact of positive shock in natural resource management is influential on increasing sustainable export value addition. Therefore, our study concludes that policymaking on the assumption of concerned symmetric impacts is misleading. Lastly, our study suggests that policymakers may strive for high growth trends and refrain from the decline in artificial intelligence and natural resource management so that stipulated sustainable value addition can be obtained. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Natural resource management; Natural resource rent; Patent application; Sustainable export; Symmetriceffect, China; Artificial intelligence; Economic analysis; Resource allocation; Contemporary economy; Economics analysis; Export value; Foreign exchange; Natural resource rent; Patent applications; Resource rents; Sustainable export; Symmetriceffect; Value addition; artificial intelligence; economic analysis; economic growth; export; natural resource; resource management; sustainability; Natural resources management",English,Article,230,11,Rural Resource Management

This study constructed an evaluation index system to measure the degree of coordinated development of tourism, transportation, and the regional economy, then built a tourism-transportation-based Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) regarding the process of the coordinated development of tourism in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTHR) from 2010 to 2020. This paper explains the current status of sustainable tourism development in the BTHR and the impact and spillover effects of transportation on tourism development. The results show that the normalized tourism coordinated development index (NTCDI) of the BTHR increased from 13.61 in 2010 to 18.75 in 2019, then decreased to 14.45 in 2020. The results of SDM show that different transportation modes have different spillover effects on tourism. Specifically, civil aviation transportation has a positive impact and significant spillover on a city’s tourism revenue (TR), while high-speed railway transportation has a negative spillover effect. The model results also show that the degree of openness of the city and city economic development level have significant positive effects and spillover effects on tourism development. Finally, the implications of related variables are discussed, and some suggestions are put forward on tourism development in the BTHR. However, there are some limitations in this study. In the future, international cooperation and data sharing will be strengthened, and multivariate methods such as social network analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning will be further integrated to achieve accurate simulation and prediction of the spatial spillover effects of tourism transportation. © 2023 by the authors.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; coordinated development; spatial spillover effects; sustainable development; tourism; transportation, China; development level; economic development; ecotourism; international cooperation; spatiotemporal analysis; spillover effect; sustainable development; tourism development; tourism economics; transportation system",English,Article,269,11,Rural Resource Management

Promoting sustainable rural construction has become an important issue that urgently needs to be solved. Sustainable countryside is a rural system that can continuously provide high-quality employment, housing, travel, medical care, education, pensions, communication, and other services for local rural residents. It can also continuously provide healthy agricultural products, good ecological products, and cultural tourism experiences for surrounding residents, including sustainable rural industry, sustainable rural environment, and sustainable farmers' lives. Sustainable rural construction is the goal and vision of the implementation for the rural revitalization strategy. This is conducive to solving the issues related to agriculture, rural areas, and rural people, narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas, and promoting the integration of urban and rural development. In recent years, rural revitalization work in Changsha (the capital city of Hunan Province) has been at the forefront of Hunan Province. In 2020, the total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery in the city was 72,219.25 million yuan; the per capita disposable income of rural areas was 34,754.3 yuan, which is 18,169.7 yuan higher than the average level of the whole province; and the income ratio of urban and rural residents was 1.7, which is 0.8 lower than the average level of Hunan Province. Rural infrastructure and public services have been significantly improved, but at the same time, there are also many problems. Based on this, guided by the theory of sustainable development and the theory of the hierarchy of needs, this paper explains the connotation and system composition of sustainable villages in detail. Beginning with the elements of a sustainable rural system, this paper analyzes the common problems and individual characteristics faced by the sustainable development of rural areas in Changsha by means of statistical analysis, questionnaire surveys, and interview surveys. Finally, this paper presents a differentiated sustainable rural optimization model and implementation path based on the problem-solving orientation and the three core elements of a sustainable rural system. These are the lives of farmers, rural industries, and the rural environment. The objective is to provide a theoretical basis for the implementation of a rural revitalization strategy in Changsha City. The results show that there are common problems in the rural areas of Changsha City, such as the loss of the young and middle-aged labor force, weakening of the main body, lack of rural attraction, low quality of public service supply, lack of resilience, lack of endogenous motivation, and low general satisfaction of residents. In addition, individual problems are also prominent. For example, the tourism attraction of tourism-oriented villages is not strong, the agricultural machinery in agricultural villages is insufficient, the traditional cultural function of traditional villages has declined, and the industrial development foundation of general villages is weak. Therefore, this study proposes four targeted sustainable rural optimization models: ecological leisure tourism, efficient ecological agriculture, characteristic protection, and integrated development. The ecological leisure tourism model designs diversified rural tourism activities such as leisure, entertainment, vacation, experience, and education through the development concepts of ecology, low carbonization, and localization to continuously enhance the attractiveness of rural ecotourism. The efficient ecological agriculture model continuously improves the supply capacity of agricultural products and the function of the agricultural ecological landscape by using ecological and intelligent technology, promoting an organic combination of specialization, large-scale production, and small farmers' production. The characteristic protection model encourages the development of cultural tourism and related industries by relying on the countryside's unique historical and cultural heritage, combined with the unique resources of the countryside, such as rural pastoral scenery, agricultural experience activities, and an ecological environment. The integrated development model relies mainly on the resources of cities and surrounding villages and towns to play the leading role of cities and realize the joint development of villages and towns. © 2023 The Author(s).","Changsha City; rural construction; rural optimization model; rural system; sustainable countryside, Changsha; China; Hunan; animal husbandry; optimization; questionnaire survey; rural development; rural planning; sustainability",Chinese,Article,639,11,Rural Resource Management

Several studies have quantified these changes, for example, measuring the effectiveness of quarantine measures and calculating the decrease in the use of public transport. Regarding the latter, however, a low level of understanding persists as to how the pandemic affected the distribution of trip purposes, hindering the design of policies aimed at increasing the demand for public transport in a post-pandemic era. To address this gap, in this article, we study how the purposes of trips made by public transport evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Santiago, Chile. For this, we develop an XGBoost model using the latest available origin-destination survey as input. The calibrated model is applied to the information from smart payment cards during one week in 2018, 2020, and 2021. The results show that during the week of maximum restriction, that is, during 2020, the distribution of trips by purpose varied considerably, with the proportion of trips to work increasing, recreational trips decreasing, and trips for health purposes remaining unchanged. In sociodemographic terms, in the higher-income communes, the decrease in the proportion of trips for work purposes was much greater than that in the communes with lower income. Finally, with the gradual return to in-person activities in 2021, the distribution of trip purposes returned to values similar to those before the pandemic, although with a lower total amount, which suggests that unless relevant measures are taken, the low use of public transportation could be permanent. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Public transportation; Trip purpose; XGBoost, Chile; Metropolitana; COVID-19; numerical model; public transport; survey; urban transport",English,Article,254,4,Mobility and Transportation

We used entropy, spatial autocorrelation, a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, and cluster analysis to explore the spatial differences between the development level and driving factors of the digital economy in Zhejiang. First, we observed spatial differences in the development of the digital economy in Zhejiang, with the level being high in the northeast and low in the southwest. Second, the influence of each driving factor represents strong spatial characteristics, and industrial innovation was the most important factor, with a distribution pattern of high in the east and low in the west. As a secondary driving factor, government input is consistent with the spatial layout of the economic factors. Commercial culture is strong in the south and weak in the north. Third, we observed multiple combinations of characteristics in the spatial differences of the four driving factors to establish the mechanism that drives the development of the digital economy in Zhejiang: the local digital economy/new business type is driven by the coupling of industrial innovation atmosphere and consumer demand, formed by developed market advantages. The three main bodies of consumers, government, and enterprises have formed a virtuous circle, promoting each other through the digitization of traditional industries and emerging digital industries, leading the development in the surrounding counties. Fourth, under the action of the four factors, three types of regional development types and 13 subcategories have generally been formed in Zhejiang: enterprise-consumer-led, business-government-led, government-consumer-led. Certain places, such as Hangzhou and Ningbo, are leading the implementation of the concept of digital development, creating the core of the digital economy in Zhejiang; Jiaxing and Jinhua are relying on transportation hub cities or global wholesale centers to rapidly develop intelligent logistics and transportation. In addition, with the support of the government, the later-developing areas are improving their infrastructure and developing the digital industry represented by ecology and tourism. For this reason, in the process of empowering digital economy development, complete attention should be paid to the development path of ecology, tourism, and other suitable digital industries in underdeveloped areas under the leadership of the government. We observed that enterprises and consumers create emerging digital industries in the leading areas of the digital economy in Zhejiang and then promote the digital transformation and upgrading of industries and governments. However, in the later-developing areas dominated by policy investment, the development of the digital economy is mostly oriented toward meeting the needs of industries and consumers, and the force driving emerging digital industries is weak. © 2023 TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY.

Traditionally, choice models are trained using data from revealed and stated preference surveys which are not only cost and time intensive but also suffer from bias due to limitations in sample size. In this article, we present a novel approach utilizing a combination of emerging data sources for non-private modes, namely public transit smart card data, taxi GPS trajectory data, and taxi trips transaction data in order to calibrate an integrated taxi and transit mode and route choice model. We apply our approach for a case study of the taxi and public transport system of Singapore using data sets obtained from the local transport authorities. We solve the first mile and last mile data gaps by overlaying the individual transport nodes against geospatial land use data in order to identify their actual origin and destination points of each journey. To model the behavioural inter-dependencies between the choice of taxi and transit options, we tested a two-level nested logit model and a cross-nested logit model. Along with the commonly included exploratory variables such as in-vehicle travel time, transfer time and number of transfers, our model also incorporates differences in travel cost and separate mode specific constants for peak and off-peak periods. Generic and mode-specific in-vehicle travel time and cost coefficients are tested in the utility functions for the transit and taxi alternatives. Willingness to pay estimates are calculated and compared against similar estimates from Singapore. We also present an application of the model by predicting the mode split between taxi and transit under selected transit and taxi fare change scenarios. Our modelling methodology is highly generalizable and can be applied to other cities with similar data availability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-nested logit; Mode choice; Nested logit; Smart card data; Taxi data; Transit route choice, Land use; Mass transportation; Motor transportation; Smart cards; Taxicabs; Transportation routes; Cross-nested logit; Mode choice; Nested logit; Route choice; Singapore; Smart card data; Taxi data; Transit route choices; Vehicle travels; data set; mobility; public transport; transportation mode; transportation system; Travel time",English,Article,302,4,Mobility and Transportation

Therefore, accurately forecasting passenger demand is crucial for metro operators to plan appropriate services before new lines open. This paper combines a large-scale multimodal agent-based simulation model based on MATSim, with additional functionalities implemented for Hong Kong transit, and a static multimodal analytical model to forecast the demand for metro service after metro extension. First, we generate an initial passenger travel pattern using the simulation model. Then, the relationship between entry-exit count and passenger origin-destination is established by matrix. The population is subsequently calibrated by linear programming optimization based on the matrix to match the observed entry-exit smartcard data. Finally, a prediction is conducted by running the calibrated model against the extended metro network for the commencement of the East Rail Line (EAL) cross-harbour extension. Calibration reduces the mean squared error by 83.8%. Model prediction indicated that there will not be significant platform congestion along the EAL, matching real-world observations after opening.

In addition, technology is also used to increase agricultural productivity, improve the marketing of agricultural products, and develop tourism village potential. In developing the Green Smart Tourism Village model, the field research was carried out at 30 villages representing 8 regencies and 1 city across Bali. This research aims to answer three problems, first there is no clear system and measurement of Green Tourism Village standardization, second there is no steady coordination between stakeholders, third there is no integrated media and information systems between Green Tourism Village, homestay and tour packages. In this study, a digital platform called SIDeWi*HuB (Sistem Integration of Green Tourism Village) in Bali is developed to facilitate a collaborative governance body of pentahelix stakeholders, namely Bali Government (Tourism Office), private enterprise (PT. RST), Academicians, Community and Tourist. For collaborative governance to be effective and efficient, E-administration is needed utilizing information technology and help stakeholders carry out the duties and responsibilities more easily. Therefore, a policy regulation is needed from the Provincial Government of Bali regarding the establishment of E-Administration for green tourism village on collaborative governance. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Travel data acquisition and appropriate emission inventory availability make estimating high-resolution urban passenger transportation carbon emissions challenging. This paper aims to establish a method to estimate and analyze urban passenger transportation carbon emissions based on sparse trip trajectory data. First, a trip chain identification and reconstruction method is proposed to extract travelers' trip information from sparse trip trajectory data. Meanwhile, a city-scale trip sampling expansion method based on population and checkpoint data is proposed to estimate population movements. Second, the identified trip information (e.g., trip origin and destination, and travel modes) is used to calculate multimodal passenger transportation CO2 emissions based on a bottom-up CO2 emissions calculation approach. Third, we develop a multi-scale high-resolution transportation carbon emission calculation and monitoring platform and take the city of Hangzhou, one of China's leading cities, as our case study, with around 10 million daily trips data and a quarter million road links. Five modes of passenger transportation are identified, i.e., walking, cycling, buses, metro, and cars. Hourly carbon emissions are calculated and attributed to corresponding road links, which build up passenger transportation carbon emissions from road links to region and city levels. Results show that a typical working day's total passenger transportation CO2 emission is about 36,435 tonnes, equivalent to CO2 emissions from 4 million gallons of gasoline consumed. According to our analysis of the carbon emissions produced by approximately 40,000 km of roadways, urban expressways have the most hourly carbon emissions at 194 kg/(h·km). Moreover, potential applications of the developed methods and platform linking to smart mobility management (e.g., Mobility as a Service, MaaS) and how to work in tandem to support green transportation policies (e.g., green travel rewards and carbon credits in transportation) have been discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Big data analytics; High-resolution CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Passenger transportation; Smart mobility; Sustainable transportation; Urban carbon emissions, China; Hangzhou; Zhejiang; Big data; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Data Analytics; Motor transportation; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Urban transportation; Big data analytic; Carbon emissions; CO 2 emission; Data analytics; High resolution; High-resolution CO2 emission; Passenger transportation; Smart mobility; Sustainable transportation; Urban carbon emission; carbon emission; emission inventory; mobility; sustainability; traffic emission; urban pollution; urban transport; Data acquisition",English,Article,301,4,Mobility and Transportation

57201023458; 57211444902,Smart cities and quality of life: a quantitative analysis of citizens' support for smart city development,2023,"Purpose: This study examined a tourism destination, Macao, a fast-progressing smart city under development, vis-à-vis a set of smart city quality of life (SCQOL) domains and verified their effects on citizens' attitudes, perceptions and support for citizen-centric smart city development (SCD). Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a quantitative approach. In particular, a questionnaire survey was used to collect data from Macao citizens. Factor analysis was used to identify SCQOL domains, while multiple linear regression and cluster analysis were used to achieve the research objectives. Findings: This study identified five SCQOL domains: smart environment, smart people, smart livelihood, smart economy and economic policy, and smart mobility. Each of the domains had a different influence on citizens' attitudes and support for SCD. Three citizen segments (passive, neutral and enthusiastic supporters) were identified. Practical implications: The five SCQOL domains, their effects on citizens' support for SCD and the three citizen segments identified can help implement the appropriate measures to enhance the target groups' SCD. The findings are also of practical value in evaluating the citizen-centric approaches on smart progress in other contexts. Originality/value: The concept of smart technology has been widely applied to all aspects of city development. The main goal of SCD is to enhance citizens' quality of life. However, most studies have only explored smart cities and quality of life in isolation. Grounded on citizen centrality, this study contributes to the literature on SCD by proposing a new concept of SCQOL, identifying the domains constituting SCQOL and their influence on citizens' support for SCD. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",", Citizen centricity; Citizen support; Quality of life; SCQOL; Smart city; Smart city development",English,Article,257,3,Urban Sustainability

58850643400; 57194853329; 58534083000,Evaluation of Traffic Flow Characteristics of Bus Stops Along Major Arterials in Abuja,2023,"Highway plays a strategic and important role in economic development. Every year, there is an increase in the number of vehicles using the same transport facilities and because of this, the traffic load becomes higher leading to increase in basic cost of transportation as the highway is the most available means of transportation for everyday commuters to move to various destinations in Abuja. Bus stops are an essential part of the road infrastructure and are essential for managing traffic and congestion. The main purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of bus stops and its characteristics on traffic flow (traffic monitoring), analysis was done using Geographical Information System tool to locate the legal and illegal points which were used as bus stop location. The research was designed to investigate traffic flow characteristics in the areas of bus stops along the major roads in Abuja. It was observed that a high number of bus stop locations are illegal bus stops; from the GIS analysis, it was observed that 4 of the 9 bus stop locations on Kubwa Expressway are illegal stop location and 16 of the 22 stop points on Airport Road are illegal locations of bus stop. Field data was then collected using two Sierzega traffic counters on two sections (point A- Before bus stop, point B - At bus stop) along Kubwa expressway. The results from the traffic monitoring show that the average speeds recorded before the bus stop are significantly higher compared to that of the bus stop which has led to the conclusion that bus stops generally have significant effect on traffic flow.

One of the consequences will be the preparation of the Regional Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMD) for the 2021-2026 period. The RPJMD was compiled during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the strengthening of other global issues such as the industrial revolution 4.0, society 5.0, advances in information technology, disruption and vulnerability to global economic crises, and food and energy issues. This research focuses on formulating strategic issues in the RPJMD document for the 21 regions to understand the framework, formulation process, and priority of strategic issues. This research is a descriptive study through a qualitative approach and is applied with practical purposes using desk study techniques. The research subjects were the RPJMD documents of 21 selected regencies/cities, especially in regional strategic issues. Data processing is done by classification technique, and data analysis is done by content analysis technique. The study results show that the strategic issues of concern are general, almost the same as the previous planning documents, such as bureaucratic reform, human resource capacity building, poverty (and unemployment), infrastructure, economic growth, and environmental natural resources. Some regions also place popular actual issues such as the Covd-19 pandemic and its recovery, the industrial revolution, smart cities, and SDGs, and only a small number of regions raise specific issues such as investment, village development, innovation, information technology, or sectoral issues such as agriculture, tourism, creative industries. This study concludes that the process of formulating strategic issues is still normative procedural, and general in nature, with a dominant technocratic approach, and needs to accommodate actual local issues and community discourse or aspirations. Formulating strategic issues also has no relation to regional development issues, more accommodating global, national issues and other planning documents without in-depth analysis. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Tourism affects the city and is affected by the city. In this context, smart environments that focus on the environment and quality of life come to the forefront in ensuring sustainability in tourism. In sustainable smart environments, noise pollution and control are important in terms of producing plan decisions and determining design criteria. In the study, it was aimed to obtain basic data for the measures to reduce and distribute the noise effect by mapping the noise caused by tourism density in Amasra, which is a small-scale touristic coastal town. In this context, noise maps were created by measuring the noise levels caused by tourism density for the city of Amasra, which is a touristic coastal settlement. In order to determine the noise levels, a total of 15 points were randomly selected, taking into account the proximity to urban uses such as hotels and restaurants as well as urban units such as avenues, streets, open spaces, or squares, provided that they are from various places in the city. Measurements were made regularly on weekdays and weekends in July. As a result of the data obtained, noise pollution levels for the city of Amasra were mapped for different situations (morning, noon, evening, weekdays, weekend, July general) using the Inverse Distance Weighting method. As a result of the measurements and maps prepared, it has been determined that the noise levels of the areas where the vehicle road, parking lot use, shopping and food and beverage places are located are mainly high.

The availability of large-scale and diverse mobility data (e.g., smart card data, GPS data), provides valuable insights into human mobility patterns. However, organizing and analyzing such data pose significant challenges. Knowledge graph (KG), a graph-based knowledge representation method, has been successfully applied in various domains but has limited applications in urban mobility. This paper aims to address this gap by reviewing existing KG studies, introducing the concept of a mobility knowledge graph (MKG), and proposing a general learning framework to construct MKG from smart card data. The MKG represents hidden travel activities between public transport stations, with stations as nodes and their relations as edges. Two decomposition approaches, rule-based and neural network-based models, are developed to extract MKG relations from smart card data, capturing latent spatiotemporal travel dependencies. The case study is conducted using smart card data from a heavily used urban railway system to validate the effectiveness of MKG in predicting individual trip destinations. The results demonstrate the significance of establishing an MKG database, as it assists in a typical problem of predicting individual trip destinations for public transport systems with only tap-in records. Additionally, the MKG framework offers potential for efficient data management and applications such as individual mobility prediction and personalized travel recommendations. © 2023, The Author(s).","Data mining; Graphic methods; Information management; Knowledge graph; Mass transportation; Railroad transportation; Smart cards; Urban transportation; Human mobility; ITS applications; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-representation; Planning controls; Public transport; Relation extraction; Smart card data; Transportation planning; Urban areas; Forecasting, Knowledge graph; Knowledge representation; Public transport; Relation extraction; Smart card data",English,Article,225,4,Mobility and Transportation

Pakistan has implemented laws and policies to enhance forest sustainability and preserve biodiversity, as it is becoming a global strategy for future water planning and management. This study seeks to analyze the impact of national park policies and laws on various factors, including biodiversity conservation, ecological processes preservation, water resource protection, consumptive and non-consumptive benefits, research and education, and the promotion of recreation and tourism. To assess the effectiveness of established policies in 19 National Parks in Pakistan, a mixed-mode research design was utilized, combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data was collected from 300 participants through a close-ended questionnaire employing a Likert scale. Analysis of the collected data was conducted using the software Smart Partial Least Squares method. The findings demonstrate that the existing policies and laws have contributed to the preservation of forest sustainability in Pakistan. The policies related to recreation and tourism; consumptive benefits; and research are more effective respectively compared to other sets of regulations. The laws and policies related to preservation of ecological processes are least effective. The study suggests that laws related to national parks need to be revised to preserve biodiversity and ecological processes. The preservation of water resources should be a major concern, and the consumptive benefits of these parks should be rechecked. Awareness campaigns are to be part of the expansionary policy framework, and while tourism opportunities should be created, a check on natural resource misuse should be implemented. The non-consumptive benefits of these parks should also be assessed. Due to its potential limitations, such as limited stakeholder analysis, difficulty in creating legitimacy in national parks due to bureaucratic structures, lack of community sensitization, and long-term trends in sustainable conservation strategies, there are certain future research directions that can address challenges in studying the impact of policies on national park habitats. There is a pressing demand for a more dynamic approach to ecological policymaking. Continuous evaluation and adaptation of policies will be essential in creating an environment conducive to sustainable development.

57221954984; 57223593838; 57221968671,Intelligent approach to mining cultural tourism potential areas based on YOLOv4: insights from Macau,2023,"Based on historical background and geopolitical factors, Macau is closely related to Portuguese cities; Macau also currently attaches great importance to the creation of a Sino-Portuguese platform and cultural tourism to drive better economic development. This study explores a method for identifying and mining cultural tourism potential areas developed under the YOLOv4 framework and cosine similarity. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) While the YOLOv4 method shows good performance and can effectively identify the architectural texture of Portuguese cities, it may face certain difficulties if applied to newly built urban areas in Macau. (2) Through the cosine similarity method, it is found that the architectural texture slices of the three island cities of Portugal and Macau have certain similarities. The city with the highest level of similarity with Macau is Lisboa, followed by Porto and Evora, while Guimaraes has the lowest level of similarity with Macau. This finding serves as a certain reference for the subsequent construction of the cultural tourism characteristics of the region. (3) Comparing the characteristics of Macau city obtained through the cosine similarity algorithm with the city slices that have a high level of similarity in Portugal, we find the following: “street networks”, “street blocks”, squares, and open space form in the Macau Peninsula, while “street blocks” and “large-scale building complexes” form in the outlying islands. These types of spaces have different scales and can be developed in the future in conjunction with cultural tourism activities on different scales. This study applies machine learning methods to the development of urban cultural tourism potential areas, which provides new perspectives and methods for urban tourism development planning. © 2023 The Author(s).

58602379400; 54885457900,Transit Fare Equity: Understanding the Factors Affecting Different Groups of Users’ Payment Method,2023,"Social equity concerns have been emerging in public transit planning. Most of the social equity research in transportation focuses on understanding different groups of users’ accessibility to various destinations. In contrast, as cities try to provide different payment options for transit users, which come with different costs per trip, limited research has been developed to under-stand the type of transit fares used by different groups of riders. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide an empirical investigation of the factors affecting the use of different types of fares by different segments of users, while assessing if there is an association between the use of different fares and socioeconomic issues to understand the equity of fare usage. Using data extracted from Saskatoon Transit’s farebox system, several segments of users are defined based on their travel patterns (i.e., frequent, infrequent, and casual users). Fare options analyzed include using exact cash payments, disposable cards, smart cards loaded with multiply options (monthly, yearly, economic) and multi-ride packages (10-ride packages). The results of the models suggest that using different fare media types is more sensitive to socioeconomic factors, rather than built environment and transit service internal factors for different type of users. Key socioeconomic factors such as educational level, percentage of visible minorities, average household size, and in-come are associated with some fare types for some users more than others. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Equity; Farebox; Payment methods; Public transport; Transit fares",English,Book chapter,239,4,Mobility and Transportation

However, most users still choose private transport modes due to the lack of flexibility and the high travel and waiting times characterizing PT. This paper addresses the problem of determining the best fleet size for a class of innovative Rapid Transit Systems (RTS) aimed at meeting passenger travel demand while, at the same time, minimizing their waiting times at PT stops through the provision of high-speed origin-destination connections without any intermediate stop. More in detail, this paper provides an optimization-based approach for the optimal resource assignment to the considered RTS operating with different headways and fulfilling a budget constraint. To test the capability of the proposed approach, a numerical example is also discussed. © 2023 IEEE.","Autonomous Pods; Passenger Travel Times Minimization.; Rapid Transit Systems; Seamless Operations, Budget control; Bus transportation; Cost effectiveness; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Light rail transit; Mass transportation; Rapid transit; Autonomous pod; Fleet sizes; Passenger travel time minimization.; Passenger travels; Public transport; Rapid transit systems; Seamless operation; Time minimization; Travel-time; Waiting time; Travel time",English,Conference paper,137,4,Mobility and Transportation

And in developing an area into a new tourism, but not having complete infrastructure will further aggravate the condition of the tourist environment in the future. Therefore, it is very important for a new natural tourism area to plan an integrated waste management system so that waste handling in the area can be handled properly and as much as possible. This plan also reflects development towards smart and sustainable nature tourism in maintaining the environment and ecosystem around the natural tourism area. In implementing the plan, the method used is to compare data on existing conditions in the Meranti Forest Nature Tourism area in terms of technical and non-technical aspects obtained through primary surveys with standards or criteria for providing infrastructure in natural tourism areas. The results of this study will show problems from the results of data comparison, which will then be solved based on the level of Urgency, Seriousness, Growth of the problem.

57211146115,Strategic Intelligence for Sacred Sites,2023,"The polysemous aspect of pilgrimage constitutes a very old human activity, sometimes religious and alternatively secular, make it a complex matter to approach and handle. The exact number of pilgrims visiting sacred sites remains undetermined, and ranges, according to sources, between 200 and 400 million people yearly (Griffin & Raj, 2017). Pilgrimages are often associated with tourism and generate, in several countries, comfortable amounts of revenue. Public or private companies manage sacred sites and at the same time, areas of services for pilgrims and accompanying persons, and an intense network of shops, places for food and accommodation, grow, sometimes haphazardly. Very often, competition takes place between destinations resulting in an accrued and largely documented need for proper management, marketing strategy, and customised communications. This is particularly important as some have discussed the manner in which host countries may consider pilgrimage as a support to regional development (Raj & Griffin, 2015). In recent years, authors - using Strategic Intelligence - have shown how pandemics could lead to collapses in financial, economic, political, social, cultural and environment fields. In such circumstances, an approach such as Strategic Intelligence could be a support to foresight (Fournié et al., 2020). Geopolitical, technical and environment issues may also be detrimental to religious practises and pilgrimages. They may also affect the peaceful development of sacred sites. Neither empirically nor epistemically, is Strategic Intelligence usually associated with pilgrimages. The current paper examines how, by taking benefit from its more recent developments, Strategic Intelligence may allow the strong and balanced evolution of a sacred place, and insert it into the regional and national economy. It may boost the creation of jobs, the identification and growth of related industries and added-valued services (Dou et al., 2018). Strategic Intelligence will also support, if necessary, the conditions for peace-building and preparation for resilience. We intend to examine here how Strategic Intelligence may offer an innovative, transversal and holistic framework to support the 'pilgrimage phenomenon' wondering if it may become a way to resilience. A path, definitely necessary, to bypass human generated conflicts, environmental changes, natural phenomena or pandemics. © International Journal of Religious Tourism and Pilgrimage.",", environmental changes; peace-building; pilgrimage; prospective; religious tourism; social cohesion; Strategic Intelligence; territorial development",English,Article,354,11,Rural Resource Management

We would like to investigate the existence of a possible connection between tourism and the social, economic, and environmental well-being of a territory. The tourism industry can improve the general well-being of a specific area by promoting consumption, reducing the income gap, and improving infrastructures. However, the well-being of the territory through enhancing the specific features of the local context and its factors of excellence can also influence tourism. In this context, we applied Machine Learning methods to investigate the relationship between tourism and well-being in Italy. The analysis used Italian BES indicators at the provincial level, referred to a time window of 17 years (2004–2020). We developed a Machine Learning algorithm based on a hybrid (unsupervised and supervised) approach to study 51 well-being indexes and 9 tourism indicators. We found a close connection (80% of accuracy) between tourism and well-being. We also selected a group of tourism indicators that have a strong effect on this connection. Using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, we detected that tourism in low season periods ranks first for importance followed by the spread of farms business and urban green areas density. Our research suggests that improved social, economic, environmental, and health well-being can positively spill over the effect on tourism arrivals and revenues in the long period. © 2023, The Author(s).",", eXplainable Artificial Intelligence; Machine learning; Tourism; Well-being",English,Article,239,11,Rural Resource Management

Indeed, technological advancements provide greater opportunities to transform rural areas into instinctive living environments - destinations to invest, work, live, and visit. However, a significant question arises: how far has this innovative technology been practised in rural activities? The current paper aims to demonstrate the application of a Malaysia Assessment Measure for Modern Rural Development (MAMRD); it incorporates the rural technology practices for appraising the score (index) towards a modern rural approach, thereby enabling lessons to be learned for further improvements. From this measurement, it was found that the aqua-tourism and smart community-based village (Kampung Padang Rumbia, Pekan, Pahang) scored 55.92% in the overall index, which could put it into a three-star rating village. The fishing-based village (Kampung Tepi Sungai, Sungai Muda, Kedah) gained two-star with 30.51%. The results become the self-checked intervention for them to move towards a modern rural approach. In the end, MAMRD shall assist all stakeholders who rely on rural and community transformation, such as Institute for Rural Enhancement (INFRA) and Jawatankuasa Pengurusan Keselamatan Kampung (JPKK).

In response to the need for sustainability, these urban centers integrate information and communication technologies to optimize and assist in decision-making for public service management. As smart cities integrate the social, physical, and digital systems, they enable a participatory model of government management. Touristic cities, which include smart city indicators and integrate sustainability and technology throughout the tourism value chain, create sustainable development based on local limitations and capacities while enhancing the integration of technology throughout the tourism destination’s value proposition. Thus, this paper aims to analyze the municipality of Foz do Iguaçu as a smart tourism destination by applying the DTI-BR model. As a result, the application of the DTI-BR model in Foz do Iguaçu showed evidence that the municipality needs to improve its indicators to be considered a smart tourism destination, which implies the need for improvements in public-private partnerships for the municipality’s development as a smart city. © 2023 by author(s).

The training quality evaluation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents could provide guidance for the decision-making of higher educational institutions and enterprises so that proper adjustments can be made to current education system and curriculum setting. However, little existing research has addressed this issue, so this study attempts to develop a method for evaluating the training quality of innovative and entrepreneurial talent responding to the requirements of smart tourism. The quality control of innovative and entrepreneurial talents for the smart tourism industry is discussed to ensure that the evaluation criteria can be implemented during the training process, then an evaluation index system (EIS) is created with weight values assigned to each index by the entropy method, and the gray comprehensive evaluation method is employed for the said evaluation task. Finally, linear regression and other experiments are carried out to prove the scientific validity of the proposed method.

While boarding is almost always available through a fare collection system, public transport systems usually do not count alighting passengers. This is either due to the overhead that may be required for passengers at exit or the installation of relatively expensive Automatic Passenger Counters (APC) counters at each vehicle. Therefore, such expensive deployments are mostly not encountered in public-transport systems. In our research, for round trip lines that are balanced in daily passenger counts on both forward and backward routes, the alighting counts of a target route are inferred using only the daily boarding data. Vehicle occupancy levels are determined on a trip basis owing to the characteristic boarding pattern of each line. The validity of the proposed method was determined and verified using video recordings of arbitrarily selected trips. Consequently, it may be possible to modify scheduling algorithms to improve vehicle fleet utilization and increase passenger comfort in public transportation. © 2023 The Authors",", Alighting counts; Destination inference; Offboarding; Smart card; Vehicle occupancy",English,Article,181,4,Mobility and Transportation

Between any consecutive checkpoints, an available slack time is available for shuttles to deviate from the main route to pick-up and drop-off customers. We implement a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation from the literature with an added shuttle capacity constraint. We use it to perform a sensitivity analysis of the system using a full factorial experimental design over three parameters, namely: shuttle capacity, level of demand and available slack time.

As an alternative to traditional web-based surveys, smart cards, an emerging technology for fare collection, can be useful to obtain massive amounts of information over a long period of time. This paper determines how smart-card data can help us understand passengers’ travel strategies, by identifying factors influencing route choice behaviour within the bus system of Shizuoka, Japan. We also examine the discrepancy between hyperpath and actual route choices based on smart-card data together with the choice principles proposed by Luo et al. [17] and arrival time-based route assignment. Origin–destination (OD) pairs are analysed with the goal to determine the most appropriate model for the transit assignment problem. We found a discrepancy between hyperpath and actual route choices, which was attributed to the erroneous assumption of random arrivals of bus services; in fact, bus operation in the Shizuoka area is timetable-based. Consequently, passengers are likely to follow the bus schedule. Route choice flexibility was displayed by regular commuters, who did not strictly adhere to a single bus route even though they usually travelled according to the same origin–destination pair. This supports the concept of “hyperpath travellers”. A variety of factors, such as perceived crowding and uncertainty of services (delays), might also affect choices when bus routes are overcrowded and another bus is due shortly. Our findings aim to assist transport planners towards predicting traffic demand more accurately, and therefore enhancing the provided public transport services and determining influential factors for commuters’ travel strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Actual choice; Hyperpath choice; Route choice model; Smart-card data",English,Book chapter,266,4,Mobility and Transportation

From the point of view of its implementation, the typology of municipalities in the network and smart solutions by territorial environment (coastal, urban and rural) are analysed. This chapter analyses the concretisation of the political discourse in a national SD programme, the pillars that underpin the design and implementation of this new approach, and the most outstanding technological solutions by territorial environments. Finally, a concluding discussion section attempts to identify the real scope of the programme and reflect about its future development. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",", Smart destinations; Smart tourism; Tourism management; Tourism planning; Tourism policy",English,Book chapter,187,3,Urban Sustainability

Modern programs for developing and implementing ""smart city""solutions are focused primarily on the interests and needs of the population. As a result, this trend directly affects the development of tourism by improving the quality of tourist services. The purpose of the study is to offer a conceptual model for creating ""smart cities""in Czechia based on smart specialization in the tourism industry by introducing modern technologies and innovations, which will result in bettering the quality of tourism services, increasing the number of tourists and improving the image of the city as a tourist destination. The methodological approach to this study is a systematic literature review. The authors identify which ""smart cities""are effective, efficient, productive, sustainable and unsustainable, and the difference between effective and productive ""smart cities"". The creation of ""smart cities""in Czechia on the basis of smart specialization in the tourism industry is substantiated. It is noted that the size of the city and the number of its inhabitants do not affect the creation of a ""smart city"". Increasing the tourist attractiveness of Czech cities will enable cities of any size to become ""smart"". The authors have determined which components of the developed conceptual model will affect its effectiveness. The findings indicate that the impact of new technologies, thanks to the advanced implementation of information and communication technology (ICT) applications, play a crucial role in data collecting and sharing for the ""smart cities""development. The article mentions examples of successful implementation of the concept in the Czech cities of Prague, Hradec Králové and Brno. In general, a ""smart city""of Czechia can make the tourism industry more accessible and efficient for both tourists and locals, ensure the sustainability of tourism in the city and increase its competitiveness in the tourism market.  © The Author(s) 2023.",", Concept; Smart city; Smart strategy; Tourism industry",English,Article,325,3,Urban Sustainability

In the last two decades, smart card data has provided the opportunity to create comprehensive travel demand data as a byproduct of a fare-collecting system. One important attribute for the planning is the purpose of the trips, which is missing from the smart card data. This research study proposes and formulates a novel method to infer trip purpose in smart card data. Previous methods either lack the concept of trip chains or did not consider both spatial and temporal perspectives of a trip. Firstly, this method discovers relations between the sequence and temporal attributes of trips with their trip purpose attribute by running a clustering method on a rich travel survey dataset (This study only uses public transit records.) that contains all attributes. Secondly, the discovered clusters are labelled and transferred to the smart card data by calculating the closeness of the trip chain of each individual in the smart card data to the clusters. Thirdly, the proportion of relevant land use types near the destination of each trip is utilized to enhance the previously calculated closeness. The proposed method is implemented on datasets from South East Queensland, Australia. Also, two recently published methods were replicated and run on the same datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The results show improvements in the proposed method compared to the existing methods of the literature. © 2023 The Authors",", Big data; Clustering; Data fusion; Mobility data; Public transport",English,Article,244,4,Mobility and Transportation

Water resource management is an important issue, especially in the European Union where most of the countries experienced a diminishing trend in their per capita renewable water. Therefore, the key goal of our research is to expand a new comprehensive framework to assess the sustainability status of water resources systems in nineteen European countries with decreasing trend in per capita renewable water (2007–2019). Our hydro-socio-economic-environmental-political index (HSEEPI) consists of eleven indicators which reagents eleven dimensions, including economic, sociology, rural sociology, health and sanitation, tourism, education, research and development, technology, human development, environment and government policies at different spatial scales. The HSEEPI scores were computed via both single and combined-artificial intelligence (combined-AI) approaches. As a threshold to define the stability of water resources systems, the HSEEPI scores were equaled 0.518 and 0.515 for European countries using single and combined-AI approaches, respectively. The results indicated that though the computed indices were at a good level, in general, the trend of instability in water resources management was observed and confirmed. Based on the results, the health and sanitation, education, technology, human development, and environment dimensions were relatively unstable and caused to a declining trend in the sustainability of water resources management across the European continent. Among the studied dimensions, tourism and technology were introduced as the best and worst factors in determining the stability of water resources systems, respectively. Also, current research could provide the vast majority of countrywide results to draw the future path of sustainable water resource management of countries by evaluating historical measures of managers.

Subsequently, the Minister of Corporate Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Dlamini Zuma, announced that Port Saint Johns was identified as one of the beneficiaries of the Smart City Programme. The smart city project is envisioned by the South African government as a means to address the high rate of unemployment, reverse rural-urban migration in which people move out from the areas to the country's bigger cities, tap into the underdeveloped tourism industry in the Wild Coast, and lastly speak to the issue of apartheid planning that saw the majority of the nation's cities grow along racial lines. The government has not identified the exact location where the 'smart city' will be located. The aim of the research was to conduct a suitability study of the proposed smart city by establishing the socio-economic profile of the area, suitability mapping of the current land uses, land cover, road network, geology settlement pattern and environmentally sensitive areas.

Multimodal transport is expected to compete with the comfort and instant accessibility that the private car offers. In this paper, the proper design of such a network is studied, which implies seamless services, in the framework of which the itineraries and schedules of the various means are coordinated with each other. A structured literature review was conducted, addressing applications of smart payment methods, as well as services related to intelligent transport systems provided in Greece and abroad, while the need to address the challenges arising from the implementation of such a system is emphasized. The city of Volos, Greece was chosen to be tested as a case study, since it is a tourist attraction throughout the year, emphasizing the need of interconnectivity. In particular, the operation of each terminal in the city is analyzed, while at the same time the interconnection between them is evaluated, with the Urban Public Transport Operator acting as a connecting link. Data were collected through an online questionnaire survey capturing the habits and willingness of 248 travelers to participate in an integrated transport system, along with interviews with stakeholders from selected sectors, i.e. public authorities, operators, businesses, academia, etc. Results showed that users are quite positive to the idea of introducing automation in public transport and consider that there will be an improvement in the situation of the road network and in their daily movements. In addition, they showed enthusiasm for the concept of multimodality, and they assessed it as a system to be quite resilient even in times of pandemic like COVID-19. Lastly, measures are proposed that will upgrade the interconnection of the terminals and consequently facilitate mobility of all passengers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Autonomous systems; City-hubs; Operators; Public transport; Travelers",English,Book chapter,318,4,Mobility and Transportation

To increase the citizens’ awareness and promote a true behavioral change, the citizens need to feel part of the process. Gamification has proved to be effective in raising citizens’ awareness, encouraging their participation, and promoting a gradual but profound behavior change in various areas such as participatory governance, tourism, culture, education, etc. Gamification can also propel a Smart Living Society 5.0 among the younger groups of the society, especially in the context of academic communities that are more knowledgeable and eager to foster a healthier, more sustainable, and more inclusive society. Smart Living Society 5.0 is an activity in the scope of the TECH - Tecnologia, Ambiente, Criatividade e Saúde - a project of NORTE 2020, focusing on creating an Academic MaaS (AMaaS). At this stage, it is essential to know about gamification use cases related to new mobility solutions and practices.

A prototype app is implemented and tested to identify potential benefits. The app uses data from open APIs, and beacons to detect the traveller context (which train or train platform the traveller is currently on). Alternative travel paths are presented to the user, and each alternative is associated with a certainty factor reflecting the reliability of the travel time prognoses. The paper also presents an interview study that investigates PT actors’ views on the potential use for actors and travellers of new information about certainty factors and travellers’ contexts, during unplanned traffic disturbances. The results show that this type of travel planner can be realized and that it enables travellers to find ways to reach their destination, in situations where the public travel planner only suggests infeasible travel paths. The value for the traveller of the certainty factors are also illustrated. Additionally, the results show that providing actors with information about traveller context and certainty factors opens up for the possibility of more advanced support for both the PT actor and the traveller.

In the present study, four environmental indicators were used as proxies to analyse the footprints of climate change in the mangrove-dominated deltaic region of the Indian Sundarbans, namely surface air temperature, near-surface atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), surface water salinity, and surface water pH. The study grouped the mangrove ecosystem into three distinct zones (western, central, and eastern sectors) and analysed 37 years of data (1984–2020). The results indicate that although both air temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have risen uniformly in all three sectors of the study area, increases in aquatic salinity have not been uniform. While the western and eastern parts of the Indian Sundarbans exhibited a lowering of salinity, the central region displayed a gradual increase in aquatic salinity. These differences may be explained by divergent dilution factors and siltation-linked freshwater obstructions. Aquatic pH has decreased uniformly in all three sectors of the present study area. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) reflects a distinctive climate change signal influencing all four primary environmental parameters. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) technology was employed to evaluate future aspects of these environmental variables using nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) networks. In synthesis, the climate change signal in the Indian Sundarbans region is mixed with “noise” that can be linked to other human inputs, including urbanisation, industrialisation, and changes in land-use patterns (shrimp culture, tourism), among others. Notably, an alarming situation is predicted to occur around the middle of the century. The study recommends the implementation of both mitigative and adaptive measures to counteract the adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change. Recommendations encompass low-carbon alternative livelihoods, mangrove plantations, and rainwater harvesting, among others. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Air temperature; Anthropogenic climate change; Aquatic pH; Aquatic salinity; Artificial intelligence (AI); Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>); Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Indian Sundarbans; Nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model",English,Book chapter,311,11,Rural Resource Management

57226019617,The Importance of Blockchain for Ecomobility in Smart Cities: A Systematic Literature Review,2023,"By 2050, cities will house at least 70% of the world’s population. Already, metropolitan areas are responsible for 70% of all greenhouse gas emissions caused by energy usage. The expanding population of city dwellers has presented new challenges to contemporary urban areas. Congestion and other kinds of inefficient urban movement irritate city people and reduce their quality of life. Cities are reducing carbon dioxide emissions in an attempt to prevent global warming, which necessitates innovative new modes of transportation. Smart cities are innovative problem-solving projects for difficulties that have evolved as a consequence of increasing urbanization and changing environmental circumstances. Today’s cities depend largely on people’s capacity to travel freely and easily in order to minimize traffic congestion, provide a high quality of life for residents and tourists, and reduce carbon emissions and environmental deterioration. Everything is dependent on an effective and sustainable transportation infrastructure. Blockchain technology is being researched for smart city applications and is used in smart mobility for ridesharing, electric charging, platoon member interactions, and vehicle communication. Although exploratory research on this issue exists, it is spread over different use-cases and applications. This research conducts a thorough analysis of the literature on the implications of blockchain for smart city mobility and transportation, as well as its potential to boost efficiency in these sectors.

Empirical material from Puolanka is used to illustrate the key tensions of this constellation. We ask: Does the concept of ‘smart shrinkage’ resonate in the context of a shrinking municipality? Is it possible to operationalise shrinkage at the local level? A group of artists has been experimenting with a very peculiar approach by branding their local pessimism (!) and thereby sympathetically ridiculing the growth orientation of a locality that shrinks fast by numbers. What about ‘multilocality’? Is it a true opportunity to increase the quality of life in depopulating regions? Like many rural municipalities, Puolanka hopes that the holiday homes and e-work will contribute to local vitality. We propose that other somewhat surprising forms of multilocality may be even more significant. Those include the global multilocalities of the entrepreneurs with immigration background that keep the last restaurant business up and running, as well as the seasonal workers in agriculture and tourism. Also, the pessimistic artists can be seen as multilocals. The peculiar connectedness that these young people have with Puolanka is of high symbolic value. © 2023 The Author(s).

Standard options to explore cities seldom offer a combination between efficiency and fun. Furthermore, a search for an exploration city app returns an unlimited supply of lookalike websites and apps, all claiming to be the best. This paper reports the development of QRioCity, an efficient and exciting way to explore cities, by the “Dragonics” student team. QRioCity offers users the option to sign up for a playful tour through the city of Porto using a public kiosk with an interactive touchscreen. There is no limit to the number of teams playing simultaneously nor there is need to provide personal data. The teams are led through the city using clues and are proposed assignments, like scanning QR codes, to earn points. At the end of the game, every team receives discount coupons for local shops or stores depending on their score, even when they play alone. This way QRioCity helps tourists enjoying the local city life while offering municipalities a chance to strengthen their local economy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",", European Project Semester; Gamification; Smart Cities; Tourism; Web Development",English,Book chapter,200,3,Urban Sustainability

Il recupero della rappresentazione territoriale del turista],2023,"L’incremento e il potenziamento delle tecnologie e della condivisione del contenuto gene-rato dall’utente hanno comportato l’entrata in scena del turismo digitale prima e di quello fisico-digitale dopo: in quest’ultimo caso si parla di smart tourism, il quale incorpora tec-nologie di informazione e comunicazione nel territorio, modificando il vissuto esperienziale del turista. Lo scopo del presente contributo è, evidenziando i tratti peculiari dello smart tourism e facendo riferimento a un periodo di ricerca svolto a Liverpool (UK), sottolineare l’importanza della fotografia come smart technology. Pur non godendo delle stesse dosi di immersività di tecnologie più avanzate, in qualità di strumento mediatico e cognitivo la fotografia abbraccia l’esperienza turistica andando oltre la comunicazione prettamente visiva: in accordo a un approccio cross-modale, l’individuo necessita di scattare fotografie nel rispetto della cattura di un vissuto multisensoriale, facendo di uno scatto mancato la possibile testimonianza di un’aspettativa delusa e, dunque, di un fallimento di promozione della destinazione. Si auspica, di conseguenza, una dovuta attenzione alla pratica fotografica all’interno di un turismo intelligente. © 2023, eum - Edizioni Universita di Macerata.

Analyzing bike-sharing use between public transport stops: A case study in Budapest,2023,"In most cities, we face an excessive number of cars, leading to congestion, lost time, increase in produced emissions, or decreased safety. Many policies are thus aiming at shifting the travel mode of conducted trips to more sustainable ones, typically public transport. Lately, bike-sharing offers a sustainable way of transport. It is most suitable to support the last mile of a trip and thus is relevant mostly to connect high-capacity public transport stops to the final destination. However, especially in downtown areas, it has the potential to replace trips by public transport. To understand whether these two travel modes compete or complement each other, a spatial analysis was conducted on origin-destination data of bike-sharing use, which start or end at a major public transport stop. Rides in different weather conditions during weekday afternoon peak hours and Saturday afternoon was considered to reveal correspondence among daily commuting and leisure trips. More than 6000 bike rentals were analyzed. Special focus was dedicated to the use of bike-sharing along frequent, high-capacity public transport lines. The analysis proved that bike-sharing has a mainly competitive role in downtown areas, as roughly half of the trips were conducted between public transport stops. The results of this study can be used by decision-makers to improve public transport and bike-sharing service or bike infrastructure, as well as by operators to optimize the reallocation of bike-sharing vehicles.  © 2023 IEEE.","Bicycles; Decision making; Intelligent systems; Traffic congestion; Bike-sharing; Budapest; Case-studies; High capacity; High-capacity; Last mile; Multi-modality; Public transport; Spatial analysis; Travel modes; Leisure, bike-sharing; multimodality; network analysis; public transport",English,Conference paper,231,4,Mobility and Transportation

Although, the Ringlet River considered the more important rivers in the Cameron Highland, probably it is the most badly affected river with records of incidences where permissible levels of certain parameters such as suspended solids, agrochemicals, and sewage have been contravened and drinking water. Recently, the tourism, agriculture, and industry in that region dramatically increased. This parameter leads to increase the pollution rate in the water of the four rivers that flow into the lake, which changes the quality of the water to the worse level. The nature of the muddy area is a parameter that allows soil erosion on the banks of the rivers especially at the time of floods. Due to these parameters, the dam loses the goal of hydroelectric construction benefit, in addition to protect catchment areas from floods, recently this dam become less useful due to the accumulated amount of mud increasing steadily, therefore, the annual removing mud sediments from the Ringlet reservoir is difficult and expensive. The aim of the study is to find logical, feasible, and economic solutions to mitigate the damage and treat it in the future. The study is concerned to estimate, evaluate, predict, and solve the problems of the Ringlet River and Ringlet reservoir which are located in the north of Malaysia. Numerous intelligent models have been developed to accurately predict and evaluate the quality of the surface water by using conventional methods that may be ineffective, inaccurate, and relatively slow in predicting results. Therefore, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology was resorted to predict water quality and sediment volume in the Ringlet Basin to assess its applicability of water quality. ANN method is selected as a statistical method applied to develop an interpretability model for decision-maker. A methodology has been scheduled to include the Ringlet river and Ringlet catchment reservoir. There are many parameters affected the pollution of the Ringlet reservoir such as urban activities, seasonal effects (flood and climate), animal’s wastes, agricultural residues, and `soil properties that may cause the erosion of the specified area. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", ANN approaches; Parameters; Ringlet river and Ringlet reservoir; Sedimentation; Water quality",English,Conference paper,382,3,Urban Sustainability

To achieve study stated objective, we derive a new index called the sensitivity index. It is a dimensionless signal used in statistic detection theory that reflects the impact of uncertainties and risks using principal component analysis. We employ the Fourier Toda-Yamamoto predictive test and find one-way causality running from the sensitivity index to tourism. Empirical results show a negative and significant predictive effect of the sensitivity index on tourism and economic growth. Summarily, sensitivity index negatively impacts on tourism development and hence overall economic growth.

These routes contribute to mending the relationship between the existing infrastructural networks and the places of interest in the landscape while respecting morphological adaptability. The case study that generated the research question explained above is the Costa dei Trabucchi in Abruzzo, Italy. The choice of a single paradigmatic case study to evaluate the method is based on the need to analyse an edge context with very scarce data, except for the coast. The advantage of this method is the efficiency based on three main conditions: overcoming limitations due to data scarcity, the use of open-source data and the multiscalarity of analyses. The result of this research work is the creation of a useful strategy to identify the most suitable routes in terms of spatial quality and walkability/cyclability. The case study is formed by the territories crossed by a railway line that has recently been decommissioned. The displacement of a railway line creates opportunities to improve the quality and use of the territory locally, with a natural evolution of the track in a greenway, and at the territorial level because it generates a network of better multimodal and sustainable mobility solutions inside and between the surrounding areas. © 2022 by the authors.","AI; DTM; image segmentation; landscape; mapping; NURBS; path; slow mobility, Abruzzi; coast; landscape; mapping; mobility; segmentation; tourism",English,Article,226,3,Urban Sustainability

It is one of the most important wine tourism destinations in the world. However, its sustainable production process, so strongly influenced by climatic conditions, can be clearly affected by the phenomenon of global warming. The ageing process of “Sherry wine” takes place in buildings known as ‘Cathedral warehouses’, an example of Nearly-Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). For centuries, they have been used to provide specific ecological conditions for biological ageing without any type of mechanical heating/cooling system. The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of climate change on this production model. For this, the annual thermal behavior of a representative winery was monitored during several years. The first energy simulation model of this type of buildings was developed and validated (daily R2 = 99%; hourly R2 = 97%). Finally, the model was simulated by modifying the outdoor climatic conditions (9 years training data sets) for a climate change scenario, applying the ‘morphing’ method for the transformation of the weather data. The results show that, by the middle of this century, the average outdoor temperature will increase by 2.3 °C (in summer up to 3.6 °C). As a consequence, the temperature in the ageing zone would exceed the comfort limit for 19% of the year, (up to 34% in hot years). For 2080, the prediction is even worse (average value of 27%).

The various modes of transportation should allow affordable and comfortable travel from one point to another in an urban city to discourage people in owning their own vehicle that may result to more traffic congestions and detrimental environmental effects. In this study, we employ empirical urban mobility datasets to evaluate a proposed Game Theory-based pricing method that can be used in ridesharing of two passengers to reduce traveling cost, while keeping the driver revenue approximately equal. We consider passenger pairings where a second commuter's origin and destination points are after the first commuter passenger, thereby, creating an overlapped and shared travel distance between the two commuters. From extensive simulations, our Game Theory-based pricing scheme resulted in (1) approximately 30% less number of active taxi trips needed to transport people from origin to destination places, (2) slight increase in the travel distance of each passenger due to the optimization of shortest path that can cater both commuters (nearly 8% on the average for the three cities), (3) reduced average passenger fare (at least 15% fare reduction) when compared to solo riding, (4) little to no driver revenue increase, and (5) lower passenger fare rate, i.e., cost per kilometer.  © 2023 IEEE.","Cost reduction; Game theory; Intelligent systems; Taxicabs; Traffic congestion; Urban transportation; Destination points; Intelligent transportation systems; Origin and destinations; Passenger pairing; Pricing methods; Public transport; Ride-sharing; Travel distance; Urban cities; Urban mobility; Smart city, Game Theory; Passenger Pairing; Ridesharing; Smart Cities",English,Conference paper,220,4,Mobility and Transportation

This article investigates the impact of sharing economy features such as core competence and resources on achieving SDGs in the tourism industry in the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). It examines the mediating impact of distinctive competitive advantage between the core competence and core resource features of a sharing economy, and achievement of the SDGs. The study also examines the moderating role of institutional support on the nexus of distinctive competitive advantage and achievement of SDGs in the BRICS countries. Questionnaires are used to collect primary data and Smart-PLS is used to analyse the data. The results indicate that the core competence and core resource features have a positive association with the achievement of SDGs, and that distinctive competitive advantage significantly mediates the association between core competence, core resources, and achievement of the SDGs. The outcomes reveal that institutional support significantly moderates the nexus of distinctive competitive advantage and achievement of SDGs.

Previous studies on urban tourists’ activities were mostly limited to official administrative units, such as attractions, blocks, and administrative districts, and rarely considered the multi-scale characteristics of urban tourism space. This study offered insights into urban tourism by depicting multi-scale tourism spaces from the perspective of tourists’ activities. Based on a spatial conceptual model, the urban destination was divided into multi-scale spaces, including tourist areas of interest (areas of intensive tourist activity), attraction-community complexes (comprising tourist attractions and supporting service facilities), and tourism districts (subregions with different tourism types). The Geographic Information System field and spatial interaction models were combined to identify multi-scale tourist activity spaces using digital footprints from geolocated social media data.

In face of the constraints that arise from this for low-density territories, the smartification of CIM presents itself as a fundamental opportunity to reverse the direction of progress or, at least, to mitigate, in the short term, the effects arising from that reality. The main objective of this text is to expose some content related to the problem of low-density territories and Intermunicipal Communities and their process towards a digitalization of services. In this sense, through the approach to the smartification of CIM, low-density territories should be constituted as instruments of territorial cohesion, functioning as “networked territories”, that is, creative and intelligent. For this, we will exemplify with the case of CIM Viseu Dão Lafões, from its presentation as a low-density territory to the demonstration of three digital projects, which should be understood as a bet on this process of digitization of intercity services. It is intended to demonstrate how these tools give citizens a greater participation in making various decisions, something that should be understood as an asset for the development of the territory. Finally, it is expected to contribute with current data (some in the implementation phase) for a reflection on the digitization of the services of the Intermunicipal Communities, as instruments of territorial cohesion and of valorization of low density territories. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Desertification; Digital technology; Low density territories; Smartification",English,Book chapter,262,3,Urban Sustainability

26634476800,Citizen participation through volunteered geographic information as equipment for a smart city to monitor urban decay,2023,"One of the issues brought on by rapid urbanization is the loss of livability owing to poor waste management, a lack of resources, air pollution, traffic congestion, and outdated buildings and public infrastructure. The idea of a smart city has arisen as one of the potential solutions to this concern. In this study, we have demonstrated how citizen science helps immensely to the growth of a smart city by crowdsourcing data about urban decay. Tehran, the capital of Iran, which is home to the history of many people’s social lives, has begun losing some of its vitality. Municipalities have plans for dealing with urban decline and revival, but we indicate that volunteered geographic information (VGI) would be more effective in turning such ideas into practice. According to our research, there are three different types of organizations active in urban renewal: municipalities, civil and urban planning agencies, and organizations that support tourism and cultural heritage. As a result, we provided a system design that outlines the duties that each institution has in relation to urban renewal. In addition, we suggested a service broker with the capacity to publish VGI in order to offer interoperability related to geographic data and services based on spatial data infrastructure (SDI). Beyond that, various types of urban decay, necessary management procedures, the sequence of information in system components, and the volunteer’s behavior confronting the system were all specified in the form of an object-oriented design. A prototype system based on state-of-the-art in open-source technologies was developed to test our hypothesis. The VGI system enabled us to monitor urban decay events in real time using the management dashboard. We have shown that volunteers can distinguish between urban declines and typical instances like a binary classifier in the quality control method proposed in this study. Performance was 90% based on the findings of the quality control.

However, the practice shows that, in the twenty-first century, this sustainability can be assured through the construction of smart villages. The ultimate goal of this study was to create a model for the development of ancient Guangxi villages that will take into account the cultural and tourist dimensions and will be based on the Smart Village concept. Analysis of existing approaches to the implementation of the Smart Village initiatives as well as of regional and local regulatory documents in force allowed identifying key aspects (factors) in this respect. Local government officials, service providers, and local residents were surveyed, and the sample was 586 people. They were asked to rate the implementation in their village of key aspects of the Smart Village concept from 1 to 5 on a Likert scale (from ""very bad"" to ""excellent""). According to the assessments collected, the top-rated and, accordingly, the most developed, was the Technological factor group, followed by the groups encompassing Culture and Tourism, then Economic, then Environmental, and Social factors. These data provided a good foundation for building a Smart Village-based model for the development of six ancient Guangxi villages, known for their unique cultural heritage (Xingping, Daxu, Huangyao, Jixiang, Fuli, and Longji Zhuang).

However, existing studies do not incorporate TR into accessibility metrics when measuring a URTN's accessibility. Here, the Buffer Time Index (BTI), which is the ratio of extra “buffer” time needed for arriving reliably to the average Travel Time (TT), is used to measure TR. Time-based, cost-based, and timebound-destination-reachability metrics which incorporate TR are proposed to measure the accessibility of a URTN. A Monte Carlo simulation is applied to estimate TR according to the probability distributions of TT components, which overcomes the difficulty of obtaining many passengers’ data. The accessibility of Wuhan's URTN during weekday morning peak hours indicates that the metrics which do not consider TR overestimate a URTN's accessibility. The evaluation results can effectively guide decisions on improvements to a URTN's accessibility. The advantage of the measures of accessibility incorporating TR for a URTN is that they not only improve the reasonableness of evaluation but also reflect an aspect of great concern to passengers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Accessibility; Monte Carlo simulation; Time reliability; Urban rail transit network, China; Hubei; Wuhan; Intelligent systems; Light rail transit; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Travel time; Accessibility; Average travel time; Case-studies; Monte Carlo's simulation; Reachability; Time index; Time reliability; Transit networks; Urban rail transit; Urban rail transit network; accessibility; computer simulation; Monte Carlo analysis; probability; railway transport; reliability analysis; travel time; urban transport; Reliability",English,Article,183,4,Mobility and Transportation

Smart management and promotion actions are vital for the sustainable exploitation of such benefits for citizens and visitors. These tasks may be hindered by a lack of economic resources and digital skills of public authorities but also by fragmented local political contexts to which these areas may be subjected. The parks in the Insubria region (between Southern Switzerland and Northern Italy) represent a relevant example of the above. The INSUBRIPARKS project aims at the harmonisation of management and promotion practices for the Insubria parks. The project activities encompass multiple actions, from the establishment of unified territorial marketing strategies to the development of supporting IT tools. Accordingly, this paper provides an overview of the IT tools ecosystem which was designed and developed within the project and an outlook on its role in empowering smart monitoring and promotion for these parks. Tools include a Web portal (enriched with Web mapping components) for a unified presentation of the tourism offers, an analysis framework for social media data exploitation in park visitors' fluxes assessment, and a mobile tool for users' engagement in the park areas monitoring.

An Examination of the Chinese Case,2022,"The digital economy, a new economic form based on Information and Communications Technology (ICT), has profoundly changed the tourism industry. Based on a theoretical analysis framework, this paper measured the digital economy index and urban tourism development index. It empirically tested the impact of the digital economy on urban tourism development through the benchmark regression model, panel threshold model (PTM), and spatial Durbin model (SDM) according to panel data of 284 prefecture-level and above cities in China from 2011 to 2019. The results show that the digital economy can directly drive urban tourism development. The positive impact in mid-western, non-tourist, key urban agglomerations, and low-level cities is more fully realised. Moreover, the digital economy has positive, nonlinear effects on urban tourism development, and the marginal effects are increasing. Additionally, the impact of the digital economy on the tourism development of neighbouring cities can be realised through spatial spillover effects, which are more dependent on inclusive digital finance; this impact has a boundary effect, reaching a maximum at 300 km. Furthermore, the conclusions are still valid after a robustness test and quasi-natural implementation based on smart cities. Finally, specific recommendations are proposed for the digital economy to improve urban tourism development according to the above findings. © 2022 by the authors.","China; digital economy; panel threshold model; spatial Durbin model; tourism development, China; digitization; panel data; spatial analysis; spillover effect; tourism development",English,Article,210,11,Rural Resource Management

The on-water landscape affects tourism potential and the quality of urban landscapes. Current research on river landscape is mainly based on remote sensing images or on-land approaches, while studies of on-water perspective landscapes at different river scales is lacking. In this paper, with Guilin city rivers taken as an example, we adopt image semantic segmentation technology to evaluate the visual landscape characteristics under different river scales, and subsequently employ automatic linear modeling to screen important factors affecting aesthetic quality. The results reveal the obvious differences between the on-water landscape characteristics of different scale rivers. The on-water landscape quality of large- and small-scale rivers is mainly affected by seven and four factors, respectively. The Karst landform of Guilin is observed to significantly improve the on-water landscape quality of large-scale rivers. By considering the impact mechanism of landscape composition on the aesthetic quality and the different scale rivers, we propose several aesthetic quality improvement strategies based on low-cost methods, including the planting of vegetation and the micro renewal of artificial constructions.

We use automobile and transit access data from the Metropolitan Chicago Accessibility Explorer and augment it with data from the American Community Survey and the Smart Location Database. We employ a Spatial Lag Model to explore sociodemographic and built-environment correlates of MAG and the bivariate local indicator of spatial association to create cluster maps to offer a way to assess the spatial equity of MAG as it relates to carless households. The findings indicate that: (1) regardless of the travel-time threshold, the automobile has an advantage over transit in providing access to opportunities, (2) block groups with low MAG are concentrated and clustered in the Central Business District, (3) Millennials and car-free households are more likely to reside in areas with lower accessibility gap to employment, groceries, hospitals, and schools for 30-min and 60-min travel-time thresholds, and (4) areas with high access gap and a high proportion of carless households have a higher percentage of African Americans and low-income households. We recommend using the bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis to classify areas according to the gap in accessibility and proportion of households without vehicles. This classification is then used to prioritize different planning actions for high-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low combinations of MAG and the proportion of carless households.

To better coordinate and achieve the multidimensional goals of a proposed fare adjustment policy (e.g., increasing revenue, managing demand, and improving equity), a fundamental step is to evaluate its travel pattern impacts, which helps us consider the policy in a bigger socioeconomic context. Existing studies rarely investigate the impacts of such a policy on different users’ and user groups’ travel patterns and transit operators’ farebox revenue using longitudinal data from sources such as smartcard data. To fill this gap, we exploit 24 weeks’ smartcard data from Wuhan, China, to empirically quantify those impacts. We find that (a) the fare increase had significant but varying impacts on travel patterns across users and user groups; (b) confronting the fare increase, commuter groups identified by the topic model reduced their trip frequency more but later as compared to other groups; (c) low-accessibility, long-distance, and single-destination metro riders were less sensitive to the fare increase; (d) when there was a system-wide fare increase with a distance-based structure, trip purposes and socioeconomic statuses could better predict the impacts on the travel demand and farebox revenue than spatiality. These findings indicate that increasing average fares while offering discounted tickets for frequent and/or captive riders could maintain the existing ridership and farebox revenue and possibly increase additional ridership. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","China; Hubei; Wuhan; Economics; Unsupervised learning; Empirical data; Policy evaluation; Rail transit; Smartcard datum; Transit fare; Transportation policies; Transportation policy evaluation; Travel patterns; User groups; Wuhan; empirical analysis; longitudinal gradient; machine learning; railway transport; transportation policy; travel behavior; unsupervised classification; Smart cards, Empirical data; Rail transit; Transit fare; Transportation policy evaluation; Unsupervised learning; Wuhan",English,Article,226,4,Mobility and Transportation

Three of them are in the tourist area on the Kapuas riverbank. Communities living around libraries have vulnerability due to environmental, economic, and educational problems. Purpose: To analyze the readiness of the three libraries in building a knowledgeable Kapuas riverbank communities. Method: Descriptive qualitative. Data collection techniques were carried out by observation, interviewing to 9 informants, and data documentation. Data analysis techniques consisted of data collection, reduction, presentation, and drawing conclusions. Findings: Long Fiah and Benua Melayu Laut Libraries have not yet ready to optimize their role as centers of education and information for communities due to the absence of library staff to manage the library, the difficulties in adding the collections, and the lack of promotion to communities. As a result, communities’ knowledge has not changed significantly. On the other hand, Bahagia Mendawai library has showed its role as a mediator and facilitator for communities to increase their knowledge. Even some innovations to foster a literacy culture can be seen from the Siberliterasi, JeLi, and Literacy Corner programs. Conclusion: As a first step in building a knowledgeable society, it is necessary to start from creating a literacy culture with strategic programs and commitment from library staff such as the literacy innovation program carried out by Bahagia Mendawai library.

It also tested the technical feasibility of using a controlled atmosphere (CA) preservation technology, which was necessary for long-distance exports. The benefits of this strategy for the rural economy were also assessed using IO techniques. Results reveal that the atemoya value chain accounted for 2.12% of the production value, 2.75% of the value-added, and 3.62% of the employment in Taitung. Furthermore, the CA technology successfully doubled its postharvest life; thereby allowing exports to countries as far as Canada, and easing the impacts of the earlier ban. This development, together with facilitating domestic sales, boosted the local economy’s output value by NTD 491 million and its value-added by NTD 237 million. In addition, it can also increase rural employment by 2235 people. Using a smart agriculture technology in this case protected a perishable fruit industry that has a thin domestic market, from the risk of relying only on a single export destination. Consequently, this has supported the sustainability of rural communities and helped them to remain resilient. © 2022 by the authors.","Canada; China; Taitung; Taiwan; economic development; employment; export; fruit; input-output analysis; local economy; rural area; rural development; rural economy; sustainability, active controlled atmosphere; atemoya; input-output analysis; Taiwan",English,Article,258,11,Rural Resource Management

Specifically, this research focuses on multimodal integration models for PTS that consider the existing infrastructure system and the socioeconomic issues typical of an island environment. This topic has received inadequate consideration in the scientific literature on islands. To achieve these aims, an analytical-numerical approach is adopted. Starting from initial origin-destination matrices (O/D) surveyed by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), a methodology was implemented to compute the geographical distribution of trips, and thereafter, the values distributed over the whole region were interpolated by Surfer software with the Kriging method. This methodology was applied to the Sardinia case study particularly emblematic because it has seen a tremendous transition over the previous decades, resulting in a massive socio-economic gap between inland and coastal areas, that led to an increase in private vehicles for transportation purposes, primarily for business and pleasure. The application, replicable in other islands that have highlighted the same socio-economic problems linked to poor mobility planning, shows an accessible spatial planning approach, combining PTS and rental for driver services, by considering the principles and issues of island contexts. This research gives an important scientific contribution by emphasising the quality of transport infrastructures, place-based organisation, population distribution, and physical configuration of the Insular Region, as well as by considering the most pressing issues of island contexts.

58141907600,Who Cares about Jellyfish? An Environmental Legacy of the Suez Canal Begins to Surface,2022,"On June 24, 2015, a huge swarm of jellyfish clogged the cooling system of an Israeli coal-fueled power plants located on the Mediterranean shoreline, almost forcing a shutdown. Images from the event displayed tons of pale blue, translucent jellies, lumped together in a container and spread over the factory floor after being removed from the cooling system filter. The spectacular incident prompted speculation that the jellyfish were foreign agents sent from Egypt to sabotage Israeli security. It may seem laughable, but this is not the first time that non-humans have figured as agents and national security threats in geopolitical dramas in the Middle East. In 2010, following repeated shark attacks on tourists in one of Egypt's Red Sea resorts, Sharm El-Sheikh, the governor of South Sinai told the media he could not rule out the possibility of the attacking shark being remotely controlled by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. In this context, foreign, underwater jellyfish armies are nothing out of the ordinary. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

To mitigate the spread of the pandemic, governments implemented various measures to reduce the mobility of the population, restricting international travel, hierarchical lockdowns, stay-at-home mandates, and work-from-home orders. In this aspect, early studies in the transportation field showed large changes in travel behaviour. However, we know less about the long-term impact of COVID-19 on people's travel behaviour. This paper explores the change in commute behaviour during the pandemic, focusing on the resilience index of transit users and its determining factors. The hist gradient boosting model was the most precise when compared with linear and other machine learning models (considering R2, MSE, MAE). The results suggested the following: (1) commuters' trips decreased unevenly in Seoul. Through machine learning algorithms, social-economic factors, and accessibility, 50% of the heterogeneity can be explained. (2) Consumer and Service Industry and Foreigner Tourism were impacted negatively continually. Neighbourhoods with higher car ownership and a higher percentage of female residents show long term weak public transit resilience. (2) Short distance commuters (less than 20 minutes) and commuters visiting city centres, returned to public transport in the second year after avoiding it during the first year of the pandemic. Considering the uneven negative results of COVID-19, this research can be a reference for policy design and effective decision making. © Author(s) 2022.","Adaptive boosting; Behavioral research; Decision making; Machine learning; Smart cards; Commute behavior; Health outcomes; Human mobility; International travel; Long-term impacts; OD flow; Resilience index; Smart card data; Spatial heterogeneity; Travel behaviour; COVID-19, Commute behaviour; COVID-19; Human Mobility; OD flow; Smart Card Data; Spatial Heterogeneity",English,Conference paper,240,4,Mobility and Transportation

The spatiality of cultural tourism determines the feasibility and convenience of the access to cultural tourism resources. Given that spatial research on cultural tourism rarely involves the underdeveloped regions in China, especially via Baidu Index data, this study aims to explore the dynamic spatial pattern of cultural tourism Internet attention based on Baidu Index through social network analysis (i.e., network density, centrality analysis, core–periphery model, etc.) in the Western Triangle Economic Zone (WTEZ), China. Research findings are as follows. (1) Temporally, the centrality is increasingly enhanced in terms of the core cities with high cultural tourism Internet attention, as well as their radiation effect. (2) Spatially, the distribution pattern of cultural tourism Internet attention is shifting from polarization to equilibrium. However, the overall network density still presents a mode of loose connection and fails to extend from the core triangle structure in the planar dimension. (3) The cultural tourism Internet attention in WTEZ presents an obvious core–periphery pattern. Xi’an–Chengdu–Chongqing is in a dominant position, and the core area spreads from south to north. (4) The spatial-temporal pattern of cultural tourism Internet attention in WTEZ is influenced by transportation, reception facilities, consumption ability, and political environment, and the main driving factors are the number of hotels, per capita income, total highway mileage, and cultural tourism policy indicators.

The fusion framework has disaggregate mixed multinomial logit models at its core that predict the most probable origin and destination zones of individual transit trips using smart card transaction records, land use data, and transit system characteristics. The logit models are estimated using revealed trip origin and destination responses from a travel survey that are augmented by land use and transit system data to provide contexts about the zones' trip generation and attraction potentials. For empirical analysis, the methodology is applied to the smart card system of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Specifically, it is tested under different system configurations (tap-on-only and tap-on-and-off) and for networks with substantial shares of automobile and walk access/egress. When applied to transit trips constructed from the smart card transactions, the estimated models successfully capture the spatial distribution of trip origin and destination at the traffic analysis zone level. The empirical analysis also demonstrates that the proposed fusion method can be appropriately used to reconcile information provided by transit smart card and travel surveys to generate up-to-date transit demand data necessary for public transport planning and operations. © 2022","Data fusion; Logit model; Origin and destination zone inference; Transit smart card transactions, Land use; Motor transportation; Smart cards; Surveys; Card transactions; Data fusion methods; Destination zones; Empirical analysis; Logit models; Origin and destination zone inference; Origin and destinations; Transit smart card transaction; Transit systems; Travel surveys; empirical analysis; land use; logit analysis; public transport; spatial distribution; traffic management; Data fusion",English,Article,206,4,Mobility and Transportation

Empirical evidence on public attitudes from Australia,2022,"Under the umbrella concept of smart mobility, new transport innovations such as peer-to-peer transport, shared autonomous vehicles, and mobility-as-a-service have been identified for their potential to improve accessibility and bridge the first/last-mile gap between origin, destination, and good quality public transport. Any future mobility plan, nevertheless, will need to appeal to a population reluctant to break habits. This study explores quantitative data collected from major Australian cities to provide a geographic context between attitudes towards smart mobility with a particular focus on eight attitudinal factors—i.e., technology, public transport, sharing, multimodality, peer-to-peer transport, smart phones and apps, environmental consciousness, and reducing private vehicle use. The quantitative analysis disclosed that regardless of location, overcoming private vehicle use, user aversion to multimodality, and reluctance to share rides with strangers' presence significant barriers to some smart mobility options. Furthermore, respondents in inner ring areas of cities have more positive views towards public transport, the environment, and smart phones, while the middle/outer ring residents on the contrary have more positive views towards private vehicles.

57205446399; 35293507700,Integrated mode of transport: a predictive model for route guidance,2022,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide real-time route guidance within city to help commuters. Design/methodology/approach: In urban areas to avoid road congestion and to reach the destination on time, intelligent transport system (ITS) utilizes recent advanced technology. To support this, existing route guidance system (RGS) suggests alternative route to commuters. However, ITS requires a system which suggests the alternative route along with the mode of transport such as public, private, taxi services etc. Integrated mode of transport (IMT) implemented in this paper guides the commuters of urban area with the best mode of transport. Inputs to our IMT predictive model are the commuter's choice of (1) minimum travel time (2) minimum cost (3) flexible route and (4) less traffic intensity along with source and destination locations. Based on these user inputs, IMT predictive model suggests optimal mode of transport. In this paper to implement the IMT model, we have considered the transport facility available in Bangalore, a city in India. The city has metro train, bus and taxi services available to the commuters. Implementation is divided into two parts. In the first part, the model checks for the end-to-end connectivity/availability of metro train facility. If metro train connectivity exists, the model concludes this as the best mode of travel. In the second part, for the routes which are not connected by metro train, the optimal mode of transport through road network will be suggested. In the first part, to check the existence of metro train along the routes between source and destination, location-IQ API is used. In the later part, to suggest transport along the road network, Q-learning algorithm of reinforcement learning technique is used. Findings: The findings are the predictive model algorithm to find the best mode of transfer and reinforcement model used in real time route guidance system.

57363865000; 6507909634; 35334051400,Inference of dynamic origin–destination matrices with trip and transfer status from individual smart card data,2022,"Background: The provision of seamless public transport supply requires a complete understanding of the real traffic dynamics, comprising origin-to-destination multimodal mobility patterns along the transport network. However, most current solutions are centred on the volumetric analysis of passengers’ flows, generally neglecting transfer, walking, and waiting needs, as well as the changes in the mobility patterns with the calendar and user profile. These challenges prevent a comprehensive assessment of the routing and scheduling vulnerabilities of (multimodal) public transport networks. Research aims/questions: The research presented in this paper aims at addressing the above challenges by proposing a novel approach that extends dynamic Origin-Destination (OD) matrix inference to dynamic OD matrix inference with aggregated statistics, highlighting vulnerabilities and multimodal mobility patterns from individual trip record data. Methodology: Given specific spatial and temporal criteria, the proposed methodology extends dynamic Origin-Destination (OD) matrices with aggregated statistics, using smart-card validations gathered from (multimodal) public transport networks. More specifically, three major contributions are tackled; i) the data enrichment in the OD matrices with statistical information besides trip volume (e.g., transfer and trip features); ii) the detection of vulnerabilities on the network pertaining to walking distances and trip durations in a user-centric way and iii) the decomposition of traffic flows in accordance with calendrical rules and user (passenger) profiles. The set of contributions are validated on the bus-and-metro public transport network in the city of Lisbon. Results: The proposed approach for inferring OD matrices yields four unique contributions. First, we allow inference to consider multimodal commuting patterns, detecting individual trips undertaken along with different operators. Second, we support dynamic matrices’ OD inference along with parameterizable time intervals and calendrical rules, and further support the decomposition of traffic flows according to the user profile. Third, we allow parameterization of the desirable spatial granularity and visualisation preferences. Fourth, our solution efficiently computes several statistics that support OD matrix analysis, helping with the detection of vulnerabilities throughout the transport network. More specifically, statistical indicators related to travellers’ functional mobility needs (commuters for working purposes, etc.), walking distances and trip durations are supported. The inferred dynamic OD matrices are the outcome of a developed software with strict guarantees of usability. Results from the case study using data gathered from the two main public transport operators (Bus and Metro) in the city of Lisbon show that 77.3% of alighting stops can be estimated with a high confidence degree from bus smart-card data. The inferred OD matrices (Bus and Metro) in the city of Lisbon reveal vulnerabilities along specific OD pairs, offering the bus public operators in Lisbon new knowledge and a means to better understand dynamics and validate OD assumptions. © 2022, The Author(s).","Big data; Data science; Multimodality; Origin–destination matrices; Public transport; Sustainable mobility, Matrix algebra; Smart cards; Statistics; Dynamic origin/destination matrixes; Mobility pattern; Multi-modal; Multi-modality; Origin destination matrices; Public transport; Public transport networks; Sustainable mobility; Transport networks; User's profiles; Big data",English,Article,441,4,Mobility and Transportation
55977634400; 35334051400,Route choice estimation in rail transit systems using smart card data: handling vehicle schedule and walking time uncertainties,2022,"Several cities around the world rely on urban rail transit systems composed of interconnected lines, serving massive numbers of passengers on a daily basis. Accessing the location of passengers is essential to ensure the efficient and safe operation and planning of these systems. However, passenger route choices between origin and destination pairs are variable, depending on the subjective perception of travel and waiting times, required transfers, convenience factors, and on-site vehicle arrivals. This work proposes a robust methodology to estimate passenger route choices based only on automated fare collection data, i.e. without privacy-invasive sensors and monitoring devices. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require precise train timetable information or prior route choice models, and is robust to unforeseen operational events like malfunctions and delays. Train arrival times are inferred from passenger volume spikes at the exit gates, and the likelihood of eligible routes per passenger estimated based on the alignment between vehicle location and the passenger timings of entrance and exit. Applying this approach to automated fare collection data in Lisbon, we find that while in most cases passengers preferred the route with the least transfers, there were a significant number of cases where the shorter distance was preferred. Our findings are valuable for decision support among rail operators in various aspects such as passenger traffic bottleneck resolution, train allocation and scheduling, and placement of services. © 2022, The Author(s).","Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Light rail transit; Mass transportation; Scheduling; Smart cards; Traffic control; Traffic surveys; Transportation routes; Uncertainty analysis; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Automated fare collection; Origin and destinations; Rail transit systems; Route choice; Safe operation; Safe planning; Statistic modeling; Time uncertainty; Urban rail transit; Urban rail transit systems; Data handling, Route choice; Statistical modelling; Transportation; Urban rail transit",English,Article,231,4,Mobility and Transportation

With connections to Cambodia and Laos, Ubon Ratchathani is located in lower northeastern Thailand, close to Vietnam and Myanmar. Therefore, there is a significant chance that this region will welcome medical travelers. High-quality medical facilities are available in Ubon Ratchathani to fulfill the needs of medical tourists. A visitor’s decision to travel to Ubon Ratchathani for medical treatment is influenced by factors other than the high-level medical facilities, such as lodging, accessibility to public transportation, and tourist attractions. The public transportation services in Ubon Ratchathani, especially the public bus system, are poorly designed and may let down visitors. The purpose of this study is to develop a smart public bus route design that will meet tourists’ demands. The concept of open innovation will be utilized to develop the model. We surveyed 400 visitors to Ubon Ratchathani. The tourists’ opinions and views of public transportation will be made public and used as an input parameter when designing bus routes. The bus route can then be constructed using the differential evolution algorithm (DE). A web-based smart public transportation system was built. In order to construct an efficient smart public bus system (SPBS), open innovation was used in the development phase.

In this paper, we focus on rural areas as key geographical loci of development by investigating the notion of the smart village (SV). Our main objective has been to improve the understanding of the adoption of the SV concept in different geographical contexts by zooming in on the case of Banyuwangi, Indonesia. In doing so, this paper investigates the adoption of SV in Banyuwangi by means of the Smart Kampung programme and reflects Banyuwangi’s situated experience against the broader SV discussions. Drawing on empirical material obtained through a series of semi-structured interviews conducted between 2020 and 2021, our analysis reveals that Banyuwangi has contextually translated SV into three main aspects of development, namely government service, economy and tourism. More broadly, our study exhibits that geographical situatedness of SV does matter, in the sense that some aspects of Banyuwangi’s experimentation with SV align with the trend in Global South countries, while some echo the trend in Global North countries. © 2022 (Ria Jayanthi, Anggini Dinaseviani, Galuh Syahbana Indraprahasta, Rislima Febriani Sitompul)",", Banyuwangi; digital technology; geographical situatedness; smart village",English,Article,187,3,Urban Sustainability

Results show that, towards the end of the century (2081–2100 period) and under the RCP8.5 future climate scenario, precipitation and evapotranspiration are projected to strongly decrease, up to 30–40% in southern Iberian Peninsula and northwestern Africa. These changes result in slight reductions in the water balance, although these are residual, non-significant and not robust across models, except at some mountainous areas (Alps, Pyrenees and Cappadocia) where the water availability can decrease up to 40–50%. Oppositely, potential evapotranspiration is expected to strongly increase in the future due to temperature increases and reduced surface water vapour pressure deficit. These changes can reach 50% under RCP8.5 in the Alps, Pyrenees and Atlas mountain ranges. These precipitation and potential evapotranspiration changes induce a strong, significant and robust increase of aridity over the Mediterranean region, particularly at North Africa and Iberian Peninsula. However, the reductions in the AI values (i.e. increased aridity) may not always reflect a change in the aridity categories since AI categories are based on ranges of AI values and not in the AI values “per se”. These results clearly indicate that the Mediterranean is projected to become in the future more arid, due to the conjugated effects of precipitation decrease and potential evapotranspiration increase. These changes, together with growing intensive farming practices and tourism, may contribute to overexploitation of aquifers, wetland destruction and irreversible natural productivity loss, leading to irreversible water scarcity and desertification in the region. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Aridity; Climate change; EURO-CORDEX; Mediterranean, Cappadocia; Iberian Peninsula; North Africa; Pyrenees; Turkey; Aquifers; Evapotranspiration; Hydrogeology; Surface waters; % reductions; Aridity; Climate change scenarios; EURO-CORDEX; Future climate; Future climate scenarios; Iberian Peninsula; Mediterranean; Potential evapotranspiration; Pyrenees; aridity; climate change; desertification; Mediterranean environment; surface water; vapor pressure; water availability; wetland; Climate change",English,Article,274,11,Rural Resource Management

However, so far there has been little empirical evidence within contemporary research concerning the degree of mid- to long-term adaptation among PT passengers to changes in the principal cause of such uncertainty within PT transport systems: Lack of service departure reliability. While most studies to date have focussed on instantaneous or short-term behavioural responses, this paper presents results from a one-year panel dataset consisting of individuals’ trip itineraries derived from smart card transactions enriched by automatic vehicle location (AVL) data. We measured long-term line route usage and departure reliability, the latter in terms of headway regularity and schedule adherence, in two panel waves. Thus, we aimed for practical indicators that may be associated with specific line routes and origin–destination PT stop pairs used for recurring trips over time. Results from logistic regression indicate a consistent significant impact of changed headway regularity and punctuality change for line routes with relatively high departure frequency. However, there is a relative indifference to long-term reliability change by a significant share of individuals that have actual trade-offs between at least two line route options, possibly indicating satisficing behaviour among PT passengers. Implications on PT path choice forecasting and route planning are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).","Economic and social effects; Reliability; Transportation routes; Behavioral response; Panel data; Path choice; Public transport; Service reliability; Smart card data; Transport passengers; Transport systems; Travel behaviour; Uncertainty; behavioral response; panel data; public transport; regression analysis; service quality; transportation planning; travel behavior; Smart cards, Panel data; Public transport; Service reliability; Smart card data",English,Article,232,4,Mobility and Transportation

Two main configurations of AFC systems can be found, characterized by whether users are required to scan their cards at the beginning of their trips (i.e., entry-only system) or both at the beginning and end of their trips (i.e., entry–exit system). Recently, there has been growing interest in implementing the latter configuration in order to provide more equitable fare structures that charge users based on distance, while arguably providing more accurate data for an origin-destination analysis of users. Therefore, this study explores the spatial and temporal differences in transit users’ origin-destination estimations that are based on the two AFC system configurations. To achieve this goal, it uses AFC system data collected from GO Transit, the operator of the regional commuter rail and bus systems in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). A comprehensive model was developed which suggests that the entry–exit AFC system configuration helps in estimating about 14% more trips than an entry-only AFC system configuration; the latter uses a set of common assumptions that are normally employed by researchers in estimating users’ destinations. Spatial, temporal and mode related differences between the two system estimations were also found. This paper offers policy makers and planners a better understanding of the possible benefits/impacts of implementing entry–exit systems vs. entry-only systems on transit users’ origin-destination estimations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Automatic fare collection (AFC); Bus service; Origin-destination estimation; Rail service; System configuration, Mass transportation; Automated fare collection; Automatic fare collection; Bus services; Collection systems; Entry exits; Fare collections; Origin destination; Origin-destination estimation; Rail service; Systems Configuration; Smart cards",English,Article,248,4,Mobility and Transportation

Approaches to OWM must be matched to the characteristics of a certain population. In this consideration, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is no exception. Organizations are being aligned to focus on sustainability matters sharing significant features with universal trends, especially the integration of 3Rs (reducing waste, reusing, and recycling resources). However, the degree and nature of advancement in the direction of sustainability vary depending on the economic level of a state. High-income economies can afford to pay a higher price to integrate 3Rs technologies. Most recent endeavors have focused on achieving ‘Zero Waste’, which is costly for low-income developing countries. The expectations of OWM systems in KSA must be estimated. In this work, the situations in KSA and other countries are analyzed, and pertinent aspects are explored. Matters relating to the sustainability of OWM are conceptually assessed. This study proposes an integrated method for an organic waste management system to achieve sustainable OWM in the context of state policy and appropriate frameworks, suitable technology, institutional order, operational and monetary administration, and people consciousness and involvement. A genetic-based waste collection transportation algorithm that enhances the efficiency of waste collection truck management is presented in line with this technology. The selected routes based on the Rfs and IPv are the most efficient among those available for the examined smart bin destinations. The minimum Rfs of selected routes is less than the maximum Rfs of available routes by 2.63%. Also, the minimum IPv of selected routes is less than the maximum IPv of available routes by 27.08%. The proposed integrated approach, including the waste collection transportation algorithm, would be beneficial across a variety of country-specific layouts. © 2022 by the authors.

The theoretical model that we suggest measures gaps between the tourists’ perceived importance of the city’s characteristics, such as transportation, personal safety, recreation, etc., and their satisfaction with them. Then we evaluate the extent to which an SC can narrow those gaps and thereby enhance tourists’ satisfaction. The evaluation was performed by aligning each characteristic with a relevant indicator of the SC standard ISO 37122. Our model identified that SC measures can contribute the most to TLV tourists’ experience in the following aspects: information, transportation, personal safety, and disabled accessibility. Therefore, those aspects should be prioritized to improve tourists’ satisfaction and a promote longer stay in the city. We also recommend that cities will continuously challenge themselves with the most advanced technologies that will enable every single tourist to fully experience the city for all purposes of visits and for the different time frames of stay. © 2022 by the authors.","Israel; Tel Aviv; Tel Aviv-Jaffa; smart city; theoretical study; tourist behavior; tourist destination, destination choice; ICT; smart cities; TLV; tourist information",English,Article,173,4,Mobility and Transportation
56490585000; 6602101827,Possibilities of using autonomous green vessels for passenger transport in urban environments,2022,"In the cities around the world, road congestions affect the waste of time, increase of harmful gas emissions, increase of costs and increase of the likelihood of accidents. Conventional solutions for such problems understand usually the construction of new infrastructure, which is often expensive, time/space consuming, and insufficiently harmonised with the long-term goals of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Innovations, new smart and green technologies, as well as automation are the crucial factors in overcoming these modern challenges of mobility and logistics in urban environments. One of the modern innovative solutions to these problems lies in the exploitation of the sea and waterways of coastal cities, i.e. cities that lie on the shores of the seas, rivers and lakes. Autonomous green vessels in urban environments have the potential to become long-term and sustainable solutions that, apart from the revitalisation of the urban water transport, will enhance the economic, ecological, safety, and even tourist aspects of the cities. The paper gives a short insight into the technology of autonomous ships and their classification, and the specifics that result from their usage in urban environments. It gives an overview and analysis of the current condition of the sea/water transport in some of the famous world cities and an overview of the currently leading state-of-the-art projects and vessels suitable for urban environments.

39361671000; 10239996300,"Exploring fishing tourism sustainability in North-Eastern Mediterranean waters, through a stochastic modelling analysis: An opportunity for the few or a viable option for coastal communities ?",2022,"Many agencies and organisations have recently proposed fishing tourism as a promising way to support fishers and fishing communities around the world. The present research paper explores the benefits from the potential adoption of fishing tourism triggered by a hypothetical promotional action plan of the local/regional authorities of a Greek NUTS-II Region. Fishing tourism is an alternative type of tourism that has received increasing attention by both the central and certain regional authorities of the country, as well as individual small-scale fishers. This action plan, in conjunction with the development of fishing tourism, would alsoaim to reduce the pressure on the overexploited Mediterranean fish stocks by gradually cutting down the fishing effort exerted by fishers who would be involved in tourism-related activities to 50% in 5 years. The benefits of this scenario are estimated utilising specific socioeconomic and environmental indices, capturing in a way the three different aspects of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental). Results indicate that the adoption of fishing tourism significantly affects individual fishers' income. However, income effects significantly depend on the vessel's characteristics, such as their carrying capacity, and on fishers' profiles mainly linked to their ability to promote the fishing tourism activity and to provide a memorable experience during fishing trips. Considering the assumptions made in this analysis, positive effects at the fisher's level are more pronounced in bigger vessels, while, the impact on vessels that can accommodate few passengers (less than four) is more marginal. At the sectoral level, the socioeconomic effects of this action plan seem to be promising, as revealed by the Gross Value Added (GVA) and the labour productivity indices, however the aggregate effects captured by other indices, especially the environmental ones are rather marginal. The potential role of fishing tourism in promoting succession and the employment of women, young descendants, and other newcomers in the currently diminishing small scale fishery workforce is also emphasized. Overall, the research paper highlights the need for tailor-made regional planning strategies for coastal development under smart specialization concepts (RIS3), considering the distinct characteristics of the respective social-ecological systems. © 2022","Alternative economic opportunities; Fishing community sustainability; Heritage tourism; Small-scale fisheries, Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (Northeast); Economic and social effects; Economics; Productivity; Regional planning; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Action plan; Alternative economic opportunity; Community sustainability; Eastern Mediterranean; Economic opportunities; Fishing community sustainability; Heritage tourisms; Regional authorities; Research papers; Small-scale fisheries; action plan; coastal development; coastal zone management; environmental modeling; exploitation; exploration; fishing; fishing effort; stochasticity; sustainability; tourism; Fisheries",English,Article,344,11,Rural Resource Management

Research shows that carpooling systems are potential solutions that could mitigate environmental pollution and urban congestion and provide cost savings for their users. Despite their potential benefits, the levels of carpooling practices among some occupations could be improved. Teachers are suitable for carpooling experiences due to their specific working conditions (e.g., timetables, destinations changes, path matches); however, there is no research solely focused on teachers. Thus, the current research aimed to analyze the barriers and incentives for teachers using carpooling systems for commuting. A panel member was selected following the staticized group technique. Panelists were surveyed to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of carpooling. Results showed that fuel savings were considered by the expert panel as the most important incentive for carpooling. For short distances, carpooling was not considered the best commuting option. Additionally, the increase in travel time and loss of personal independence were identified as relevant barriers. Based on the opinions of experts, it can be concluded that carpooling barriers outweigh the incentives for the commuting of teachers. To promote carpooling practices, institutional mobility plans with advantages for carpoolers could improve the teachers’ perceptions about carpooling. Future carpooling strategies should consider these results to promote incentives and address the identified barriers. © 2022 by the authors.","carpooling; sharing economy; smart mobility; sustainable mobility, commuting; incentive; mobility; panel data; perception; travel behavior; article; economic aspect; human; incentive; perception; teacher; travel; work environment",English,Article,217,4,Mobility and Transportation
57200147417; 36194636700,The value of additional data for public transport origin–destination matrix estimation,2022,"Passenger origin–destination data is an important input for public transport planning. In recent years, new data sources have become increasingly common through the use of the automatic collection of entry counts, exit counts and link flows. However, collecting such data can be sometimes costly. The value of additional data collection hence has to be weighed against its costs. We study the value of additional data for estimating time-dependent origin–destination matrices, using a case study from the London Piccadilly underground line. Our focus is on how the precision of the estimated matrix increases when additional data on link flow, destination count and/or average travel distance is added, starting from origin counts only. We concentrate on the precision of the most policy-relevant estimation outputs, namely, link flows and station exit flows. Our results suggest that link flows are harder to estimate than exit flows, and only using entry and exit data is far from enough to estimate link flows with any precision. Information about the average trip distance adds greatly to the estimation precision. The marginal value of additional destination counts decreases only slowly, so a relatively large number of exit station measurement points seem warranted. Link flow data for a subset of links hardly add to the precision, especially if other data have already been added. © 2021, The Author(s).","Data acquisition; Additional datum; Estimation precision; Marginal values; Matrix estimation; Measurement points; Public transport; Travel distance; Underground lines; Matrix algebra, Dynamic origin–destination; Entropy maximization; Lagrangian relaxation; OD estimation; Public transport; Smart card",English,Article,219,4,Mobility and Transportation
57208154020; 55660905300,Utilizing Wi-Fi Sensing and an Optimized Radius Algorithm to Count Passengers with Transfers to Enhance Bus Transit O-D Matrix,2022,"The origin and destination (O-D) of public transit passengers are important for the planning and operation of the transit system. However, only 46% of public transit agencies have a smart card system in the US, and most of them require an entry-only tap, which prohibits identifying passenger destinations unless utilizing an estimation model. Therefore, there is a need for a cost-effective and automated solution to facilitate the majority of the US transit agencies in recognizing the origin and destination of passengers as well as capturing passenger transfers. This paper created a novel algorithm for transit agencies to count passengers with the consideration of transfers using a cost-effective Wi-Fi sensing-based approach. Two pilot studies were conducted in the city of Louisville, Kentucky on three different bus routes to explore the feasibility of the method. A Wi-Fi detector was installed in the bus to detect passengers, and a manual counting was performed to be used as ground truth data. After data collection, the proposed algorithms were applied to optimize the detection radius and to eventually find origins, destinations, and transfers. Analysis revealed that the proposed Wi-Fi-based approach is capable of recognizing 78.7% of the total passengers as well as detecting their boarding and alighting activities. The paper demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to detect passengers with a reasonable detection rate by using Wi-Fi technology on bus routes, which makes it feasible for transit agencies to conduct frequent and low-cost network-level passenger O-D studiesPractical Applications This work utilized Wi-Fi technology to count the passengers of public transit and to identify transfers. Current practice in data collection is transitioning from traditional manual methods toward more-automated approaches. The current practice relies on a manual method such as surveys or newer technologies such as gaining information from a smart card that passengers swipe when they get on a bus. Surveys are a manual method that requires intensive effort to gather the data and process it. On the other hand, the smart card system can be expensive to install and operate, and most public transit providers in the US have limited budgets and large coverage areas. The algorithm in this work is a practical solution for public transit agencies to gain information about the boarding and alighting activities along their routes. A Wi-Fi sensor installed inside the bus can be used to estimate the number of passengers who board and alight the bus. The results of the novel method in terms of detection rate demonstrated higher accuracy than previously proposed algorithms. This work also revealed the ability of the algorithm to capture transfer activities in terms of the number of passengers and other transfer characteristics.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","GIS; Network-level O-D matrix; Passenger transfers; Route-level origin and destination (O-D) matrix; Wi-Fi detection, Kentucky; Louisville; United States; Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Data acquisition; Geographic information systems; Mass transportation; Smart cards; Surveys; Urban transportation; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); matrix; Network level; Network-level origin and destination matrix; Origin and destinations; Passenger transfer; Route-level origin and destination  matrix; Transit agencies; Wi-fi detection; algorithm; bus transport; GIS; matrix; public transport; transportation planning; urban transport; Matrix algebra",English,Article,447,4,Mobility and Transportation

As a tool for analysing the uneven economic development of regions, we used a method based on the comparison of regions by gross regional product per capita, which formed the basis for determining the funnel of backwardness of the region among others in terms of economic growth. The analysis was conducted for 2010 and 2020. The calculations made it possible to identify areas that differ significantly in development potential. It is proposed to use the ideas of the smart specialization concept as a new model of the Ukraine’s regions economic development in order to equalize interregional disparities. Revealed the essence of this concept implementation on the example of the Carpathian region economy in 2020 is revealed. It is determined that the formation of educational, tourist and construction clusters in the region are the foundations that will form a long-term strategy for its development. The main measures for the introduction of construction and educational clusters are proposed. The components that determine the innovative development of Ukraine on the basis of the Global Indices of Competitiveness and Innovation are analysed. Proposed the formation of economic policy, which is aimed at solving strategic tasks of the regions socio-economic development – ensuring economic growth and quality of life in Ukraine. It is justified that the application of the smart specialization approach in long-term regional strategies will contribute to a synergistic effect for both human and innovative development, which is the goal of the new regional economic policy.

We aimed to explore the diffusion law and influencing factors of smart tourism city so as to provide reference for the construction of smart tourism city. By employing the 249 cases in China from 2012 to 2019, we revealed the spatial-temporal characteristics and driving factors influencing the diffusion of smart tourism city policy by employing the event history analysis method. The results reveal that the diffusion of smart tourism city policy presents the typical S-shaped curve in cumulative adoptions over time. Furthermore, the diffusion of smart tourism city policy presents the spatial distribution characteristic of the Hu Line, which spreads from the eastern coastal areas to the central inland areas. Moreover, there are multiple driving sources for the diffusion of smart tourism city policy, among which economic lift force, intellectual support force, technological pull force and demand impetus force are the important driving sources for the policy diffusion. © 2022 by the authors.

58988880700; 58989027500,Research on the Influence of Cultural Consumption Pilot Policy on the Urban Industrial Structure Upgrade; [文化消费试点政策对城市产业结构升级的影响研究],2022,The construction of cultural consumption pilot cities is the entry point for the cultural industry to take the stand of the main battlefield of economic development. The National Cultural and Tourism Consumption Pilot Cities and Demonstration Cities promulgated in 2020 is an extension of this pilot policy. The realization of the cultural consumption pilot policy depends on the demand-side guidance and the supply-side reform，which is in accordance with the development strategy of industrial structure upgrade. However，the existing literature rarely evaluates the effects of the cultural consumption pilot cities construction policy；and especially，in-depth research on how this policy influences the urban industrial structure upgrade is lacking. This paper adopts two indicators of industrial structure rationalization and industrial structure sophistication to measure the industrial structure upgrade，takes the construction of cultural consumption pilot cities as an exogenous impact for quasi-natural experiments，utilizes the difference-in-differences model to explore the net effect on industrial structure upgrade，and effectively avoids the endogenous problems caused by reverse causality. Empirical study shows that the construction of the cultural consumption pilot cities has significantly promoted the sophistication and rationalization of urban industrial structure，and the results pass the robustness tests such as parallel trend test，placebo test，and replacement of core variables. Nevertheless，there is regional heterogeneity in such enhancement. Specifically，by categorizing cities based on the cultural resource endowment，the study finds that the cultural consumption pilot policy has a greater influence on the enhancement of the sophistication and rationalization of the non-national-historical-and-cultural cities，while the influence on the sophistication of the industrial structure of the national-historical-and-cultural cities is not significant in the statistical sense. Also，by categorizing cities based on the technological endowment，this paper finds that the cultural consumption pilot policy has a greater influence on the industrial structure upgrade of non-smart cities，but only promotes the rationalization of the industrial structure of the smart cities. The reasons lie in the differences in the initial state of the urban industrial structure，as well as the differences in the timeliness of policy performance caused by different urban environments. Further mechanism analysis shows that the cultural consumption pilot policy can make policy effects of enhancing residents’consumption preferences on the demand side and upgrading consumption supporting facilities on the supply side，then promote the urban industrial structure upgrade through supply and demand synergy and the industrial correlation effect. Therefore，it is believed that government departments should focus on the urban characteristics，promote the differentiated experience of cultural consumption pilot cities，enrich cultural consumption scenarios，and build a supply and demand matching service platform. Compared with the previous literature，this paper has the following marginal contributions and innovations. Firstly，this paper considers both dimensions of supply and demand，and systematically sorts out the influence mechanism of the cultural consumption pilot policy on the industrial structure upgrade. Secondly，the heterogeneous division of cities by cultural resource and technological resource endowments is closer to the actual development of cultural industries and modern service industries，which can provide a basis for the large-scale replication and promotion of pilot city experiences. © 2022 Editorial Board of Modern Economic Science.

On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, this study takes the core area of Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal as the research subject. Based on tourism network data, this paper constructs an evaluation model of the network heat of scenic spots, and uses the methods of trend surface, kernel density, GIS analysis technology to explore the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of the network heat of red tourism. The research results show as follows. (1) In terms of time evolution, the popularity of the red tourism network in Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal shows an evolutionary path of steady rise. The seasonal network heat shows a fluctuating trend of ""three peaks and four valleys"", and the seasonal change of red theme heat is affected by the occurrence time of red events. (2) In terms of spatial evolution characteristics, the core of the red tourism network in Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal has evolved from ""single core"" to ""three cores"", and the radiation of the high-density area of the red tourism network to the surrounding areas is increasing. In Southern Jiangsu-Northern Jiangsu-Central Jiangsu, the heat degree shows a decreasing trend. The degree of homogeneity of the red tourism network along the Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal is relatively poor, and the development speed of red tourism is fast in the southeast and slow in the northwest. (3) The development of red tourism in Jiangsu section of the Grand Canal is influenced by the regional policy support, the level of economic development and the construction of smart tourism. The integration of cross-city cultural and tourism exchanges plays a role in promoting its development. The epidemic situation has a certain impact on red tourism, but the change of tourists' tourism preference brings a turning point for more less well-known scenic spots. © 2022, Science Press.

7403269980,Special thinking and green development path of urbanization in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; [青藏高原城镇化发展的特殊思路与绿色发展路径],2022,"Urbanization in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a special mission in defending the national security, the national ecological security and the Asian Water Tower. It plays an irreplaceable role in the world, which ensures the realization of modernization, the happiness of all ethnic groups, a stronger ecological security and a more solid national security barrier in this region. This study discusses in detail the special driving force, development path, development goals, development pattern, green development mode and green development path of new urbanization in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which are completely different from the inland areas. It is believed that the urbanization of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a process characterized by low-level development, cultural inheritance, national defence, water tower protection, small agglomeration and large dispersion, social inclusion, and ecological enrichment. It is driven by a single investment, tourists, services, and counterpart support in an alpine and anoxic environment. In the future, the urbanization development thinking in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is, firstly, to take the defence of the territory and the border as the guideline to ensure national security, and a sufficient population in the border and rural areas at a fast, stable and appropriate growth rate. By 2035, the permanent population of the plateau will reach 16 million, and the urbanization rate should be 52.5%, which will be stable in the middle stage of urbanization for a long time, and the quality of urbanization will be promoted comprehensively. Secondly, driven by green development, the ability and level of ecological products and ecological services will be continuously improved, highlighting characteristics and folk customs, and promoting cultural diversity and inclusiveness. And we encourage local herdsmen to live in the town and graze in the township so that they can build beautiful cities and towns and advance in-situ urbanization on the plateau. Thirdly, based on the principle of small agglomeration and large dispersion, the pattern of borderland security urbanization is composed of ""three circles, four belts and multi-nodes"", emphasizing the agglomeration effect of the three circles (Xining metropolitan area, Lhasa metropolitan area, and Qaidam urban circle), four belts (urban belt along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, urban belt along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, town belt along the Tangbo Ancient Road, and border town zone), and multi-nodes (multiple important urban nodes, and important border towns). Fourthly, we should guarantee the channel development, including the construction of new infrastructure facilities such as the Qinghai-Tibet high-speed railway, and the building of plateau smart cities, so as to safeguard national security. Finally, taking territorial security as a top priority, we should speed up the reform of the land system in border cities, set up pilot special zones for borderland land reform, and focus on border cities in major national strategic layout and territorial spatial planning. © 2022, Science Press.

However, designing a taxi-sharing system to effectively allocate taxi resources and provides high public acceptance services is an urgent problem to be solved. Furthermore, to what extent the taxi-sharing can be an eco-friendly service without bringing extra pressure to urban emission, fuel consumption, and transportation system is still an unanswered question. This paper proposes a methodology framework to design a taxi-sharing system with driver routing probability based matching and dispatching algorithms. The methodology is capable of matching multiple taxi trips into a sharing trip, with consideration of temporal and spatial feasibilities. The matching of sharing trips includes the determination of which trips to match and the sequence of the destinations. To examine the potential of operation efficiency improved and fuel consumption reduced in taxi-sharing, three scenarios are proposed with different constraints, representing different operation strategies. The sharing trips are then dispatched to the taxis. The potential of operating performance improvement and the potential of fuel consumption reduction are analyzed in the three scenarios. It is found that the delivery part of taxi-sharing may produce more travel distance because of the detour. The key factor for taxi-sharing service to reduce Vehicle Kilometres Travelled is the idle trips and the taxi resources saved. Considering both delivery trips and idle trips together, although taxi-sharing can reduce total fuel consumption in the city, it may increase traffic pressure in certain range area, especially in the key road sections or intersections in the urban road network and the area with high traffic demand. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Data handling; Fuels; Motor transportation; Probability; Roads and streets; Urban transportation; Geo-spatial data; GPS data; Matchings; Potential demand; Probability modelling; Routing probabilities; Routing probability model; Sharing systems; Spatiotemporal analysis; Taxi-sharing; assessment method; demand analysis; fuel consumption; GPS; intelligent transportation system; methodology; probability; strategic approach; transportation mode; transportation system; Taxicabs, Fuel consumption; Routing probability model; Spatiotemporal analysis; Taxi-sharing",English,Article,280,4,Mobility and Transportation

However, despite the threats posed by climate change and variability on heritage tourism sites, there are limited research and management interventions to help build the resilience of threatened sites. South African national parks are home to numerous heritage sites, including unique ecosystems, prehistoric ruins and rock art, which are still undocumented. This research assesses the risks imposed by climate change and variability on heritage sites within selected South African national parks. Assessing and prioritising risk is important to designing effective conservation and preservation strategies. The participatory Climate Vulnerability Index was used to assess climate vulnerability on three heritage sites within Kruger, Mapungubwe and Table Mountain national parks. The research developed and used a seven scale semi-quantitative risk analysis tool to rank and prioritise the identified climate related threats. Survey questionnaires were administered to park visitors to assess their perceptions of climate change impacts on heritage sites. Discussions with key informants were also done using in-depth interviews and focus groups. The results show that the vulnerability of heritage sites to climate change was high at all sites. Warming temperatures, drought and flooding intense rainfall are the main climatic stressors. A SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) action list for the identified critical climate related risks was developed. To build future resilience, the paper recommends changes in how threatened tourism heritage sites are presented to visitors, improved funding for the documentation of the impacts of climate change on the heritage sites and developing anticipatory action to manage potential impacts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",", climate vulnerability; heritage tourism; national parks; risk analysis",English,Article,268,11,Rural Resource Management

57202386611,"Investigating the influence of weather on public transit passenger's travel behaviour: Empirical findings from Brisbane, Australia",2022,"Drawing on transit smart card data allied with local weather station records over a 12-month period, this paper takes Brisbane, Australia as the study context and examines the way in which weather impose influences on public transit passenger's travel behaviour. In terms of transit passenger's spatiotemporal origin–destination (OD) information, a new travel behaviour indicator called stickiness is developed to reflect passenger's travel similarity in using the transit service over a period. By applying a suite of regression models, it shows that weather's effects on transit passenger's travel behaviour vary by temporal period and passenger type. In general, weather is shown to exert a stronger effect on passenger's stickiness during midday off-peak hours in comparison with either AM peak or PM peak. Across all types of passengers, child passengers are found to be most tolerant to weather changes and even be stickier to their regular travel pattern during AM peak. The modelling results also reveal that when it relates to journey-to-work or journey-to-school, weather's effects on alighting location are much smaller than other three OD-related travel behaviour features (i.e., boarding time, boarding location, and alighting time). In contrast with the postponement during AM peak, transit passengers are prone to bring forward their trip back home during PM peak in response to poor weather conditions. Moreover, this paper verifies that weather parameters are not singly perceived by transit passengers but as an interrelated unity in shaping transit passenger's travel behaviour. By enriching the weather–travel behaviour scholarship, the empirical findings of this study are helpful to render a holistic understanding of the weather–travel behaviour relationship and have important implications for transit operators in building a more weather-resilient transit system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Brisbane; Queensland; Smart cards; Urban transportation; Brisbane; Empirical findings; Interaction effect; Passenger travels; Public transit passenger; Stickiness; Transit passenger; Transit smart card; Travel behaviour; Weather; public transport; transportation system; travel behavior; weather; Regression analysis, Interaction effects; Stickiness; Transit smart card; Travel behaviour; Weather",English,Article,280,4,Mobility and Transportation

Co-creating Sustainable and Resilient Tourism with Cultural and Creative Industries",2022,"Sustainable tourism is one of the key sectors in the South Baltic Sea Region (SBSR), which belongs to the role model for sustainability—the Baltic Sea Region (BSR). In this context, resilience, recovery and sustainability become key common threads calling for new approaches mitigating negative impacts, upscaling resilience capacity and boosting recovery in the post-pandemic era. The present work aims at revealing conceptual and practical pathways for policy makers and businesses in revitalizing sustainable tourism in the region by emphasizing cultural and creative industries (CCIs) as strong contributors to sustainable development and economic ecosystems, such as tourism. Tourism is also one of the key thematic areas of the smart specialization strategies (S3) in the SBSR. However, there is almost no link between CCIs’ potential for sustainable and resilient tourism and their contribution to the co-design and co-creation of S3. CCIs are rather absent agents in quadruple helix networks supporting S3 policy implementation. The literature on this topic is still premature, and represents a clear gap in knowledge. By virtue of these circumstances, the present research investigates how CCIs contribute and reveal new linkages between local assets, potential markets and societal challenges by engaging them as proven sustainable innovation and transition brokers in transnational quadruple helix partnerships following S3 policies in accordance with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), thus supporting sustainable and resilient tourism. Moreover, this paper aims at advocating for development of rural and peripheral regions, thus reducing the so-called “rural marginalization”.

Qualitative research and a semi-structured interview method are used to collect the opinions of six experts on the data results. Finally, the results are discussed with the multivariate inspection method. Although the current electric bicycle system is convenient, the study found that the service quality of the airport is sufficient; that the fare of the subway is low and popular with students if the system can ease the crowd during peak hours; and that the login and security check time can be shortened, which can help improve the operating convenience of the system interface and link the information of leisure and tourism activities. On the other hand, adjusting fares, increasing seats, planning for women-only ticketing measures and travel space, providing disinfection or cleaning facilities in public areas, and improving passenger’s public health literacy and epidemic prevention cooperation will further enhance the student travel experience, improve the smart city and green tourism network, and help achieve sustainable urban tourism. © 2022 by the authors.

57203585626,Experimental Education of Collaborative Design. the Case of an Inclusive Bus Stop for a Tourist Transportation Hub,2022,"The design of transport infrastructures must be developed for social sustainability. Collective transport, interfaces and pedestrian infrastructures must guarantee a combination of quality characteristics, where accessibility according to the universal design approach is prominent. Universal and inclusive design must be consistent with user expectations and needs, and so, the associated process must involve people with disabilities and elderly citizens to understand their difficulties in using the built environment. This is the context of the research project Accessibility for All in Tourism (2017-2019), that focuses on the development of a pilot study of an accessible, smart and sustainable bus stop to be located at a tourist transportation hub. The research was developed considering the perspective of multiple users, professionals in the disability field, and experts who applied technical standards. This co-design process attended to different users' needs. It was a process that required a transdisciplinary approach by the team, integrating students and people with disabilities, walking and observing them and taking into account senior tourists' perceptions through an inquiry survey. This paper describes the collaborative approach that was developed with Civil Engineering students at the Institute of Engineering at the University of Algarve, influencing their work and knowledge. The results indicate that students perceived the concepts of universal design and inclusive design and designed the bus stop for social sustainability. An inclusive society requires input from different users of the built environment and knowledge of their specific needs by engineering designers. Pedestrian infrastructure and interface design demand user-centred approaches and so, processes of co-creation with communities. © 2022 Tempus Publications.

58035138000; 57943970900,Self-sufficient City as Organizing Principle for Sustainable Development: Making Bozcaada a Self-sufficient and Sustainable Island,2022,"Depopulation of small cities—mainly because of single sector economy and lack of attractiveness, vibrancy and joy—is an important issue we have to deal with. To deal with this and similar challenges, it is a need for an urbanism that uses the law of nature, advanced technologies, and self-organizing adaptive systems. Furthermore; while the earth is facing essential problems deriving from carbon emissions, lack of fresh water, pollution from agriculture etc., the ecological performance of cities is gaining attention as a critical issue. In these terms, the transition towards self-sustaining urbanity may help cities become more environmentally and human-friendly, as well as more attractive and better places to live in and worth to visits. Creating self-sufficient city models based on self-organizing adaptive systems and on inhabitants’ activities could be a response. These models would be society-based, complexity-led and landscape-driven. This paper, beside of aiming to elaborate the urban self-sufficiency concept by a multi-disciplinary perspective, also aims to explore and use the excising potentials of Bozcaada, which weren’t used till now particularly because of its tourism-oriented economy policies. With a total population of 3,000 inhabitants in 2019, and with a territory of 40 km2, Bozcaada Island is an extraordinary case study due to its low population and density, tourism-oriented economy and its external and internal geographical barriers (climate and hydrology). The paper aims to seek ways of transforming Bozcaada to a human and environmental friendly place with a multi-sectorial economy where people use to live in and visit it during the whole year. In these terms, evidence will be provided regarding to how the environmental concerns can become organizing principles in new urban strategies for achieving a sustainable development. It will elaborate the smart tourism as a potential tool for achieving a sustainable tourism development and protection of cultural heritage. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Attractive cities; Elf-sufficient city; Human and environmental friendly cities; Sustainable development; Sustainable tourism",English,Conference paper,310,3,Urban Sustainability

41261091800,The Rebranding of Newcastle as a Smart City. Cui Bono?,2022,"The city of Newcastle, regional capital of North East England and home to “the UK’s smartest street” located a short distance from its brand new Helix district, is described as having successfully transitioned from a traditionally industrial city to a “smart” city, able to use digital tools to address issues such as congestion, pollution, waste reduction and parking, with the dual objective of “helping people to live better lives” and of making the city more attractive to businesses, investors, international students, and tourists. While ubiquitous in political and academic discourse, the idea of “smart city” is strikingly absent from general public discussion, with very low awareness among those whose lives are supposed to be most improved. Criticisms of smart cities tend to focus on the fact that the services associated with smart cities constitute a very lucrative market, on the lack of residents’ involvement in changes that will directly affect their everyday life, and on the potential for misuse of the data collected. Drawing primarily from a range of published material such as policy documents, newsletters, working papers, announcements, websites, and brochures produced by the key players of the smart city, as well as from conversations with ordinary residents, this article aims to contribute to the discussion on smart cities by confronting official discourses with “actually existing” practices, through the case of the mid-sized city of Newcastle. It explores the uses of smart city tools and discourse to rebrand the city of Newcastle and revitalise civic pride, setting the smart city promises against actual improvements to the lives of local residents as well as their perceptions of their city. The first section of the article sets out the elements of the smart city to show how the characteristics of the city of Newcastle made it an ideal terrain for experimentations; the second section analyses the deployment of the smart city agenda in the city, focusing on the discourses and perceptions of the range of players involved. The third and final section seeks to understand who is set to benefit the most from Newcastle’s transition to a “smart city”.

57221257277; 59139552000,Evaluation of Taxi Service with Regard to the Drivers Income Using Simulation Support,2022,"Taxi is a popular service in many cities and tends to improve mobility without being the costumer directly charged by the vehicle maintenance. A company or a self-employed person (i.e., the taxi driver) is the one in charge with vehicle maintenance, fuel payment, insurance, etc. The taxi service request is mainly made through mobile applications, where costumers select payment method, origin and destination, and an information system, aware of the taxi and costumer locations, associates the closest taxi to the customer request. Typically, this service is analyzed from the costumer side mainly looking for travel time and fare reductions. There is a lack of research that investigates the taxi drivers side. In this work, we evaluate the taxi service from the taxi drivers point of view. We have already published part of this study with the focus on the taxi driver income on previous work and here we extended the research to assess other features such as the impact of the vehicle type engine (electric, ethanol, gasoline and CNG) in taxi drivers income and expenses, the percentage of the fleet occupation given different service demand, and the difference between traveled occupied distance and total distance. Given a demand and costs, a simulation is proposed to detail and evaluate the appropriate balance between drivers income and demand scheme to keep the service viable to the drivers. Simulation was conducted with the support of SUMO traffic simulator using as scenario, a medium-sized city in Southern Brazil. Based on literature, city hall documentation and Internet news, input values were chosen to make the simulation as realistic as possible. As conclusion, we found that the city town hall must define a maximum number of taxi licenses for feasible taxi service. The vehicle type with regard to energy source has a major impact in the taxi driver’s profit. Despite of high acquisition cost, electric vehicles have a lower cost per km driven in comparison to other vehicles. If the daily traveled distance increases, the difference between electric vehicles and others decreases, making electric vehicles more advantageous. Fleet occupancy also impacts driver’s profit. With regard to the fleet occupancy, as demand grows, the fleet occupancy levels rise and as well as the driver’s profit. Finally, we found that difference between total traveled distance and occupied distance increases as the number of travel runs increases. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Driver’s profit; Fleet management; Taxi service, Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Taxicabs; Travel time; Vehicle actuated signals; Driver’s profit; Fleet management; Mobile applications; Origin and destinations; Payment methods; Service requests; Taxi drivers; Taxi services; Vehicle maintenance; Vehicle types; Profitability",English,Conference paper,394,4,Mobility and Transportation

It is generally accepted that one of the main benefits of self-driving cars could be reduced road congestion, as current roads are expected to have much higher capacity if most of the traffic is shared by autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, the convenience of autonomous vehicles can generate significant further traffic, both from people who currently are not able or prefer not to drive, and more generally, through the concept that increased road and parking capacity often leads to increased traffic. Further gains are expected by using shared autonomous vehicles instead of private ones, with people buying mobility as a service (MaaS), bringing new services to the market such as shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) instead of just buying cars. SAV concept is an autonomous rental vehicle flowing from point A to point B that controls all driving functions for an entire trip by itself without any human intervention, such as steering, braking, and acceleration, which are performed by a computer system that operates with the support of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The surrounding environment is perceived by sensors, cameras, and LiDAR technology. The vehicle navigates to a location/direction through GPS and computer mapping. SAVs enable users to get the benefits of a autonomous private vehicle use without the cost of ownership. Once arrived at the destination, travelers do not have to search for a parking lot or pay for it. This paper will focus on the development of an Ontology for SAVs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Autonomous; Driverless; Ontology; Robotaxi; Self-driving; Shared; Shuttle; Vehicles",English,Book chapter,283,4,Mobility and Transportation

Global tourism and real estate development has generated important territorial effects due, among other causes, to heavy urbanisation and land occupation. Consequently, one of the global future challenges facing the discipline of geography is to provide understanding and empirical response to this phenomenon. This article is based on new approaches in geography that allow us to apply territorial intelligence to coastal tourist destinations. The first sections reflect on territorial governance, territorial intelligence and smart tourism destinations. Subsequently, the importance of coastal areas in tourism is justified in order to propose applied tools and technological solutions that can help managers to analyse situations and make decisions. As a result of the authors’ research and transfer, several systems of indicators are proposed that evaluate and measure the type of tourism development, its impacts, sustainability and its own governance. These new approaches are considered fundamental for the planning and adequate management of the territory. © 2022, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona.

In this paper, the problem of detecting tourist spots in a city with the help of city dwellers, in strategic setting, is addressed. The city dwellers vote against the different locations that may act as a potential candidate for the tourist spot. For the purpose of voting, the concept of single peaked preferences is utilised, where each city dweller reports a privately held single peaked value that signifies the location in a city. Given the above discussed scenario, the goal is to determine the location in the city as a tourist spot. For this purpose, we have designed the mechanisms (one of which is truthful). For measuring the efficacy of the proposed mechanisms the simulations are done.

However, the embeddedness of places and the local tourism sector in the modes of production, consumption and capital circulation of contemporary capitalism remains oftentimes unaddressed. This chapter, therefore, adopts a political economy perspective and examines the macro-frameworks that condition tourism development in Finnish Lapland, in tandem with attempts to consolidate its gateway position to the Arctic. The aim is to encourage a more nuanced view on gateway status in regions where tourism development is driven by multi-scalar stakeholder interests and embedded into competitive regional development initiatives. While the devastating effects of climate change and human induced pollution on the fragile terrestrial and maritime Arctic ecosystems are well recognized, the spatial reimagination of Lapland in the Arctic represents another neoliberal step towards the total commodification of the environment. © CAB International 2022.

55262614000,From smart cities to a happy and sustainable society: urban happiness as a critical pathway toward sustainability transitions,2022,"While smart cities have great potential to contribute to urban sustainability, related discussions and applications are often criticised as highly technocentric rather than people-centric. To ensure smart city policies align with the path of sustainability transitions, citizen well-being and social values should be carefully considered in urban planning. This viewpoint article argues that urban happiness associated with welfare, health, and quality of life is the gateway to transforming smart cities into sustainable living places. Firstly, happy cities share similar and vital characteristics with transitions, such as equity, justice, inclusion, and participation. Intelligent technologies would not benefit socio-technical systems without addressing these factors. Secondly, urban changes require years and decades to ferment. Planners and policymakers should concern about technologies’ long-term influence on well-being and urban liveability. Finally, technology innovation is a process of urban planning, not the destination. Thus, exploring whether cities’ “smart” input can effectively turn into consistent happiness is necessary. Given a lack of linkages between smart and happy cities in past studies, I propose conceptual metrics for evaluating happiness-driven and sustainability-led smart cities. My arguments also present several trains of thought to open more dialogues for researchers and urban planners. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",", Happy cities; smart cities; social sustainability; urban planning; well-being",English,Note,203,3,Urban Sustainability

57203095034,Exploring Transit Use during COVID-19 Based on XGB and SHAP Using Smart Card Data,2022,"As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues, many protective measures have been taken in Seoul, Korea, and around the world. This situation has drastically changed lifestyle and travel behavior. An important issue concerns understanding the reasons for giving up transit use and the potential impact on travel patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. To shed light on these issues that are essential for transit policy, this study explores transit use choice, such as whether users have given-up transit use or not, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two days of smart card data, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, were used to look at users who gave up transit use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The choice set of the dataset includes two alternatives, for example, transit use and given-up transit use. An extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model was used to estimate the transit use behavior. Shapley additive explanations were performed to interpret the estimation results of the XGB model. The results for the overall specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy of the proposed XGB model were estimated to be 0.909, 0.953, and 0.931, respectively. The feature analysis based on the Shapley value shows that the number of origin-to-destination trip feature substantially impacts transit use. As such, users tend to avoid transit use as travel time increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed model shows remarkable performance in accuracy and provided an understanding of the estimated results. © 2022 Eun Hak Lee.",", Smart cards; Travel time; Coronaviruses; Estimation results; Feature analysis; Gradient boosting; Potential impacts; Protective measures; Shapley; Transit use; Travel behaviour; Travel patterns; COVID-19",English,Article,236,4,Mobility and Transportation

We present a new urban mobility concept, Connected Swarm Cycling, that creates a group of people cycling together for a while in a common direction or destination. We assume that the concept of Swarm Cycling can significantly change the mobility behaviour of citizens and will be a building block of green mobility for sustainable cities in the future. Utilizing an OSRM11http://project-osrm.org/ routing service with support of trip intersection computing, the system inducts the cyclists into a cycling swarm. The swarms are formed automatically via peer-to-peer connection when cyclists come in proximity, and the information of the swarm and individual cyclist will be synchronized within the swarm via a Nearby Mesh Network. Supporting the implicit interaction within or between swarms, smart wearables are utilized to realize use cases like swarm member identification or signalling in case of merging or splitting of swarms. In this paper, we also present a technical description of our system, including the protocol and network model to support the coordination and synchronization within the swarms.  © 2022 IEEE.","Building blockes; Cycling systems; Green mobility; Implicit interaction; Mobility behavior; Social groups; Sustainable mobility; Swarm cycling; Urban areas; Urban mobility; Peer to peer networks, implicit interaction; sustainable mobility; swarm cycling",English,Conference paper,196,4,Mobility and Transportation
57188983697,Partnering with technology firms to train smart city workforces,2022,"Globally, all Smart Cities require strong infrastructure, ways of sustainable development, and importantly Smart Workforces to handle and implement the processes required to keep the city “Smart.” With technology impacting almost all areas of work, also changing very frequently, and impacting the grassroot process, training and reskilling have become especially important. With tools for self-learning and personalized learning, the skill gaps can be manageably handled. The Technology Firms can effectively partner and provide the newer technology tools, which can be very effectively used for training, skilling, reskilling, and upskilling. With Natural Language Processes (NLP) facilities becoming better, these companies can also provide support in training in local languages. This chapter attempts to first bring in need for training by collating some of the new skilling requirements of Smart Cities. It then gets in detail of new methodologies that can be used for skilling and how some of the technology companies can partner in handling this. Even at early stage of conceptualization of “Smart Cities,” some of the technology companies helped in creating “Model Conceptual Smart Cities,” which were then expanded to include the “Smart City” implementations of today. The chapter also brings in some new thoughts to encourage the companies to spend and partner for reskilling in Public–Private Partnership (PPP) mode, to ensure continuity in this activity. The chapter also suggests the possibility of creating a “Resource Pool” for a city for getting a better return on investment required for creating this Smarter Workforce. It also goes into some suggestions on how this smarter workforce can lead to “Community Led Innovation” environment. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Case study of Liepāja,2022,"Development of modern technologies and urbanisation enable cities to provide a broad range of services even at night, which means that the nightscape is becoming more used. The goal of the study is to develop recommendations for planning the night-time outdoor space and its elements in an urban environment, with a view to improve the functional and aesthetic quality of the city, and to reduce light pollution. To achieve this goal, the authors studied theoretical materials, analysed the experience of three cities in developing lighting plans, conducted field research and made photographic records to assess various areas, compiling and creating a visual representation of the results. The city-level focus in solving night-time cityscape problems is on the drafting of lighting master plans. Using such plans, one can spur tourism and economic growth, and improve the quality of life among the locals. On the level of the city, elements such as edges, neighbourhoods, roads, landmarks, viewpoints and nodes play an important role at night. One has to identify these elements and highlight them based on the recommendations developed. The proposed development of a Liepāja city lighting plan would strengthen the city’s identity, improve the safety of the night-time use of outdoor spaces, facilitate navigation, and create aesthetically pleasing views. Furthermore, this is an opportunity to reduce light pollution and transition to sustainable solutions through the use of various smart technologies associated with lighting. © 2022, Landscape Architecture and Art.

55185388400; 55538961100,Overtourism - identifying the underlying causes and tensions in European tourism destinations,2022,"Overtourism is a much-debated topic in academic literature and among policy makers. The discussions have led to insights into the different aspects of overtourism, but the focus has largely remained on finding solutions for the direct, and often short-term, effects of (over)tourism faced by cities “in general”, rather than identifying and solving the underlying causes and tensions. To take this needed step, it is essential to be aware that the causes, tensions and impacts related to (over)tourism, the interaction between the city’s stakeholders as well as the issues outside tourism that a city is facing are all context specific. A way to identify the underlying causes and tensions in a specific city is to utilize the Smart City Hospitality Framework. The framework, which merges the concepts of sustainable development and city hospitality, provides a diversity of lenses to frame specific tensions that fit within a local context and, as a result, support a contextualized analysis of impacts and intervention strategies of city tourism. In this chapter we utilize the framework to analyse the role of tourism in three European cities (Gothenburg, Darmstadt and Warsaw), each with a different relation to tourism. A deliberate choice was made here to not focus on major tourism cities that are commonly associated with overtourism, to highlight how tensions related to overtourism are also appearing in cities where “in general” there still seems to be room for an increase in tourism numbers. The cases make clear that, also in these cities, the problematic relationship between tourism and the liveability of cities for local stakeholders, as well as the lack of equality with regard to the distribution of benefits and disadvantages, (start to) harm the sustainability of urban tourism development. The cases also highlight the disillusionment of people with the extent to which their voice is heard and taken seriously. In the discussion we identify a number of avenues for further research and experimentation. © Jan van der Borg 2022.",,English,Book chapter,324,3,Urban Sustainability

The paper aims to capture the impact of COVID-19 shock on the tourism industry and economic progress using a dynamic distribution lag model. The data from 2001 to 2019 along with the epidemic shock are used to produce forecasts for Germany, France, Spain, and Italy until 2030. The results reveal that Germany's ""smokeless industry"" will fall by 6.9%, which puts 1.09 million jobs at risk. The declining trends will continue until 2023; however, they will match the current trends in 2024. Similarly, the expected losses for France, Spain, and Italy during 2020 are 9.63%, 9.35%, and 9.34%, respectively. The lockdown situation will shrink the real output and dampen GDP per capita.

In terms of the daily cruise service, a key part lies in the accessibility to attractive hinterland destinations. From the viewpoints of safety, efficiency, and environmental protection, public transport is considered to be a good option to access hinterland destinations. It requires the design and selection of public transport routes for cruise passengers by evaluating service quality. The existing studies focus on the evaluation of transport service quality incorporating the passenger perspective while there is a lack of studies oriented towards the cruise passengers. In this paper, we aim at setting up a four-layer cruise passenger-oriented evaluation system. Two cruise centers located in Hamburg, Germany, and Qingdao, China are focused. The proposed evaluation system identifies the weights of 21 criteria and the ranking of the transport routes for cruise passengers in different age groups. Considering the berthing time of cruise ships and the commuting time of local residents, the proposed evaluation system also provides suggestions for the one-day tour itinerary of cruise passengers in the hinterland. Moreover, the preferences on transport routes of different-age cruise passengers are disclosed to promote the relevant improvement in public transport infrastructure in specific transport routes. In doing so, this paper aims at supporting the smart city development for port cities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

57191965289; 14041898100,Exploring Collective Memories in a Smart City Environment,2022,"Within a city, there are numerous places of memory. Places that touch the heart of several and diverse groups of people. For example, fans of a football team may be interested in the memories that the former team headquarters encapsulate, whereas refugee descendants may care more about places that were significant for their ancestors who were settled in a city. Such places of memory are often forgotten by the city residents and remain hidden to the city visitors. Could we exploit these places to enhance tourism in a city with the use of technology? In this work, we demonstrate a trustworthy participatory platform that can be used to manage and disseminate stories about places that are related to the collective memory of specific groups of people. Stories of places are uploaded by people that are familiar with their history. Visitors can access these stories either by using a portal or a mobile app. The portal may be informative for a pre visiting search and the mobile app may be used during their visit providing route recommendations, thematic routes, and meaningful information about the places. We also present a case study about the forgotten places of a refugee group that is now hidden within a city. Our study suggests that such a system can be used to exploit the hidden collective memory of a city promoting tourism development of local societies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Collective memory; Mobile applications; Recommendation systems; Smart cities; Smart services; Thematic routes",English,Conference paper,242,3,Urban Sustainability

6505853024; 57194043587,Smart governance in historic urban destinations - evidence from Croatia,2022,"In this research we explore smart governance (SG) elements, strategies and outcomes using a sample of small cities located in two Croatian regions, coastal and continental. These differ from one another not only in terms of their history and administrative culture but also the intensity of their tourism development, significantly affecting the way the city is governed with regard to the main SG categories. Historic city status was chosen as a common denominator for the cities in the sample. Building on an extensive literature review, an extended version of the smart governance model inaugurated by Bolivar and Meijer (2016) was suggested, to encompass contextual factors (size 'Äì referring mostly to small cities; location - associated with different administrative cultures; tourism development intensity - measured by the set of intensity indicators; the status of the historic city as a specific local condition) and end with some policy measure proposals. A mixed-method approach was employed to address these issues. Firstly, an importance-performance analysis was conducted to evaluate the cities’ mayors or deputies’ perception of each of the proposed smart governance categories. Subsequently, a qualitative analysis exploring the cities’ strategic documents was conducted to determine progress on smart governance and their development orientation. The research results have demonstrated the existence of an importance-performance gap between smart governance categories, with a few of them proving to yield significant impact. The findings are discussed in the light of contextual factors. The conclusions facilitate further understanding of this phenomenon and shed light on the specifics of governance in historic urban destinations within a given context. The major limitation of this study is the relatively small sample (42 out of 94 historic cities) and its focus on just one country (Croatia). Nevertheless, the findings may be valuable in the sense that they broaden the understanding of smart governance in historic cities. Furthermore, implications may be derived from the results obtained for both researchers and practitioners. There is a lack of studies on smart governance taking into account specific contextual factors, and we hope this research may help fill that gap. © Jan van der Borg 2022.",,English,Book chapter,349,3,Urban Sustainability
57200323254; 10540364400,Smart Specialization in Australia: Between Policy Mobility and Regional Experimentalism?,2022,"This article describes and analyzes the transfer of smart specialization (S3) from Europe, where it originated, to Gippsland, Australia. It identifies factors that are likely to enhance and, on the other hand, diminish the contribution of S3 to development in this region, and, more generally, to peripheral regions around the world. The policy mobility literature provides the analytical framework. It is used to explore how the validity of assumptions that underlie the efficacy of S3, in a destination site, and the institutional and political factors that must be accounted for through adaptation and reflexive policy learning, impact on the viability of policy transfer. This discussion demonstrates the links between geography, and entrepreneurship and innovation, and the challenges of linking the originally more or less homogenous framework to one concerned with development in heterogenous regions. An action research, constructivist approach is adopted. It yields fine-grained ethnographic data that reflects the importance, for effective evaluation of such transfer, of conceiving of a region as a relational space, where social interaction and connectivity drive and define the nature of change. The concomitant focus on process reveals that the intertemporal interchange between the means and ends of policy makers, must be carefully observed before proceeding to ex post evaluation of outcomes. Consequently, the article adds to the theoretical understanding of the complex processes involved in transferring regional policy approaches across spatial contexts. It provides valuable insights relevant to economic geographers, scholars, and practitioners concerned with regional development and innovation policy, and those exploring concepts and ideas associated with the policy mobility literature. © 2022 Clark University.","Australia; Gippsland; Victoria [Australia]; analytical framework; governance approach; innovation; peripheral region; policy analysis; regional development; specialization, experimental governance; innovation; policy mobility; regional development; smart specialization",English,Article,262,11,Rural Resource Management
57189463535; 56365233000,Challenges of Mediterranean metropolitan systems: smart planning and mobility,2022,"The interaction between society and the environment is everchanging, in turn leading to changes in both environmental and social systems. Population growth, namely, is far from homogeneous: there has been a shift in the centre of gravity of the population’s living places, with almost half of the world’s population living near coasts. This it leads to significant changes in both land use and landscape characteristics. Among the sensitive areas of the planet, the Mediterranean is one of the most critical because of the high environmental load generated by the settlement weight of urban and metropolitan systems, by infrastructures, and by industries along on its coasts. If we consider the state of this basin, we can say that it is currently under pressures because of growing urbanization, growing population, productive activities, and tourism. Among the problems, the strong disparities between North and South of countries leads to an impending risk, namely that the use of advanced technologies and of smart governance methods could be limited to the North of Mediterranean Sea with the slightest chance of reducing the pressures on the whole basin. Mobility represents a primary sector in the evolution processes of man-made systems, and the implementation of new mobility systems is a challenge in the direction of the efficiency of urban and metropolitan structures, and of ever-increasing sustainability of transport services. Territorial load, environmental condition, and climate change are closely related. Hence control and innovative management of the functional parts of the metropolitan systems (mobility, dwellings, production, tourism, and so on) are a necessity, and a technical and organizational challenge that the countries of the northern and southern coasts will have to tackle with great determination and attention. The paper explores the issue of the metropolitan mobility within the Mediterranean territorial system, analysing its current situation and its potential evolution. Quantitative data are correlated with the contribution of the European cooperation policies. The first part is a recognition of the state of metropolitan mobility in the main cities of Mediterranean basin. The paper continues deepening the concept of smart city and the main Euro-Mediterranean policies directed at public mobility. The lesson from the paper is that a better use of public mobility can improve the state of Mediterranean cities and it can help the achieving of more sustainable environmental conditions. © 2022 The Authors.

7103332066,Guided by data: A logistical approach to tourism in the platform economy,2022,"Logistics is a relatively hidden subject in tourism studies. This theoretical article advances a logistical approach to the study of tourism in the platform economy. It is argued that the platform economy rests on logistical accumulation, which means that human practices are not just predicted but ultimately steered in order to generate profitable digital data streams. At the same time, “smart”, mobile media platforms provide unprecedented logistical affordances to people to navigate and manage various flows. Tourism is thus taken as a logistical intersection, where the steering mechanisms of the platform economy entangle with the needs and capacities for orientation, coordination and orchestration among travellers. The social expansion of logistical accumulation raises questions of human agency, especially in relation to tourism, as well as a need to study how the basic tension between “steering” and “being steered” unfolds in different sociocultural settings. The article provides a critical account of the logistical frictions, conflicts and inequalities characterizing digital tourism geographies. It also actualizes the need for further exchanges between media studies, tourism studies, and critical geographical research on logistics. © 2022 The Author",", Logistical media; Platform economy; Platformization; Social differences; Tourism; Travel",English,Article,182,11,Rural Resource Management

The paper carries out an analysis of the potential territorial impact—transport networks and geographies of living—of telework in the Italian national context. The analysis highlights the potential relevance of the application of telework in certain metropolitan areas that present urban poles where economic sectors with a high propensity for telework are centralised. This survey relates the large stock of tourist housing in the vicinity of large metropolitan areas to a potential demand arising from the change in housing preferences towards more pleasant contexts made possible by the application of telework. In conclusion, this work aims to contribute to the construction of a platform for the Italian context—lagging behind but with recent legislative measures on smart working—aimed at favouring the definition of research lines able to enhance the potential offered by the application of telework for environmental, social, and territorial sustainability objectives, and it also aims to outline possible territorial scenarios for the main metropolitan areas. © 2022 by the authors.

The European Union has set high goals in waste management in its legal framework. The Republic of Croatia, as a member of the EU, will have to respect the set requirements. The main aim of this paper is to analyse waste management in counties across Croatia with special emphasis on the cities and municipalities in the Opatija Riviera area, as well as to monitor the amount of urban waste generated by tourism. The Opatija Riviera is the study area of this research as the inhabitants and tourists in cities generate more and more urban waste, which is closely connected to unsustainable patterns of consumption and production. The authors use different methods in the paper such as analysis of the existing condition, observation, and the accumulation, processing and interpretation of secondary data. The main source of data are statistical reports and reports on the business conducted by municipal companies. The research question is whether an increase in tourism indicators affects an increase in waste in a tourism destination. The authors indicate towards a need to change consumption and production in order for citizens to generate less waste, while at the same time using waste as a resource in the process of circular economy. Inadequate waste management contributes to environmental pollution, air pollution and the intensification of climate change. The results show that the analysed tourism destinations do not record an increase in total waste despite an increase in tourism indicators. The paper proves that the observed units of local self-government are more actively adhering to EU regulations pertaining to waste management. The paper’s contribution lies in the knowledge that waste in cities has three different values in terms of ecology and economy – raw materials, energy and the environment. In the scientific sense the paper contributes to existing literature, while in the practical sense the paper advises decision-makers in units of local self-government that tourist cities in the Opatija Riviera area need to promptly implement the circular management model, undergo a digital transformation and implement smart solutions. All of these projects fall within the scope of the European Union’s next financial period (2021-2027), which additionally shows just how important these issues have become.

With advances in smart mobility, mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) schemes allow passengers to book a combined ticket for all their trip legs. This detailed information about the origins and destinations of door-to-door trips offers the opportunity to coordinate the schedules of public transport lines to reduce the passenger travel times. In this study, we model the coordination problem of feeder and collector lines by explicitly considering the regularity of the feeder lines and the transfer times of passengers. The coordination problem is modeled as a nonlinear non-convex problem and reformulated to an easy-to-solve convex optimization problem. Because of the travel times uncertainty, we also introduce a stochastic optimization formulation based on the sample average approximation approach.

As in such services trips usually start before the appearance of pooling partners, knowing the probability of getting matching with another order (i.e., matching probability), the expected detour distance, and the expected shared distance before the start of each trip is essential for passengers to evaluate their willingness to pool and for ridepooling platforms to offer attractive discounts. In this paper, assuming that every ridepooling passenger shares vehicle space with at most one another during the entire trip, and ridepooling orders in each (origin-destination) OD pair appear following a Poisson process with a given rate, we propose a mathematical modeling approach to predict the matching probability, the expected ride distance, and the expected shared distance of each order under a first-come-first-serve strategy in dynamic ridepooling service. The method defines unmatched passengers at different locations along the exclusive-riding path of each OD pair into different seeker- and taker-states, formulates the complex interdependency of the matching probabilities, matching rates and arrival rates of (unmatched) passengers in different states into a system of nonlinear equations, and generates the matching probabilities and expected ride/shared distances of all OD pairs simultaneously. Under the same first-come-first-serve strategy, we simulated the occurrence, movements and state transitions of ridepooling orders based on a 30*30 grid network and the real network of Haikou City in China. In comparison with simulation results, we show that the method proposed in this paper can generate fairly satisfactory predictions under diverse matching conditions and demand intensities. © 2021 The Author(s)","China; Haikou; Hainan; Forecasting; Dynamic ridepooling; First come first serves; GPS positioning; Matching probability; Matchings; Modeling approach; OD pairs; Ride distance; Shared distance; Smart phones; comparative study; GPS; mobile phone; numerical model; prediction; probability; travel behavior; Nonlinear equations, Dynamic ridepooling; Matching probability; Ride distance; Shared distance",English,Article,282,4,Mobility and Transportation

Therefore, walkability is a core urban design element because of being advantageous onto three fronts: health, livability, and sustainability. Adopting walkability as urban solution relieves conceptual and practical tensions between the individualistic interests manifested in the desire to own and use private cars, and the need to reduce transportation-based consumption. This review advocates that long-term health benefits from walking and physical activity are the premier incentive to repurpose our cities to be more sustainable and more walking friendly, and spark behavioral change into reducing car dependency for all daily transportations. The review inspects physical elements of the built environment that make the walking trip feasible and desirable, such as connectivity, accessibility, and closeness of destination points, presence of greenness and parks, commercial retail, and proximity to transit hubs and stations. Hence, this review explores a few popular walkability evaluation indices and frameworks that employ subjective, objective, and/or distinctive methods within variant environmental, cultural, and national context. There is no unified universal standardized walkability theory despite the need for rigorous evaluation tools for policy makers and developers. Furthermore, there is a lack of emphasis on air quality and thermal stress while approaching walkability, despite being important elements in the walking experience.

However, the existing literature shows no studies on how to evaluate bi-objective multimodal accessibility under travel time uncertainty. In order to fill this research gap, this paper creates a multimodal super network based on smart card data in which the transfers among taxi, bus, and subway modes are developed and applied. Next, we propose a two-stage opportunity accessibility model to calculate bi-objective multimodal accessibility under travel time uncertainty. Then we propose a multimodal reliability path finding model and a reliability boundary convergence algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, we conduct a large-scale real-world case study. It is found that the impedance heterogeneity between different modes is significant, and multimodal travel has better accessibility than a unimodal one.

Despite a generally severe urban–rural development imbalance, these rural areas feature well‐developed basic infrastructure and diverse economic activities. Rural revitalization policies in these areas have emphasized the development of cultural and ecological tourism, which has spurred economic development and given rise to a trend of villa construction. Residential buildings sit on large areas where natural resources are abundant. These advantages are conducive to the development and use of sustainable resources. This study proposes an incentive policy encouraging rural residents to renovate their buildings to include rainwater conservation and solar power generation. The Delphi method, an analytic hierarchy process, and fuzzy logic theory were combined to establish an AI‐MCDM model, with applications of artificial intelligence and multiple‐criteria decision making. Using Conghua District, Guangdong Province as an example, the study suggested that the model is beneficial to increasing the willingness of rural residents to reconstruct and renovate their residences, promoting the development of a low‐carbon ecological region, Wenquan Township. We conducted the Delphi process twice to assess and validate incentives for installing natural resource conservation structures in agricultural areas. Nine criteria were identified, which can be divided into three main dimensions of participation situation, generating capacity, and storage facilities. The proposed AI‐MCDM model developed using the Delphi–Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process Model has high objectivity and can support rural areas in developing low‐carbon, sustainable characteristics. The findings can serve as a reference for governments formulating incentives to encourage the installation of rainwater conservation and solar energy generation structures by rural households. © 2021 by the authors.

To facilitate such a process, a new stream of research has emerged that utilizes social fitness networks (SFNs), such as Strava, to obtain user AT data. However, SFN datasets exhibit bias towards certain types of users (e.g., fitness-oriented cyclists, males, young users). In order to overcome this limitation, we tested a Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) as a primary data collection method and post-hoc tool to evaluate and complement SFNs by paying special attention to cycling data. In particular, PPGIS was administered in the City of Glasgow via 816 participants partitioned into Strava and non-Strava users. Spatial and contextual information was determined from the collected data. Statistical analyses demonstrate that PPGIS non-Strava users were distinct from PPGIS Strava users, as the latter tend to be associated with certain characteristics (i.e., younger, more fitness-oriented, proficient in smart devices), indicating the need for a complementary dataset. Spatially, a weak correlation (r = 0.22) between the route choices of PPGIS cyclist users and those of Strava indicates inconsistencies between the two; however, the origins and destinations were moderately positively correlated (r = 0.53 and r = 0.48, respectively). Further, statistically significant differences were observed between PPGIS Strava users and PPGIS non-Strava users, inferring the need for a supplementary tool. Our findings imply that PPGIS is a promising tool to fill these gaps. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Active travel; Crowdsourced; PPGIS; Public participation; Social fitness network; Strava, Glasgow [Glasgow (ADS)]; Glasgow [Scotland]; Scotland; United Kingdom; cycle transport; data acquisition; GIS; local participation; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; transportation safety; travel behavior",English,Article,245,11,Rural Resource Management

In this paper, we simultaneously analyze aggressive driving and distracted driving of taxi drivers under three different trip categories. Trip origin is considered a transition from without ride-order to with ride-order travelling or from with ride-order to occupied travelling, and a destination as a transition from occupied to without ride-order travelling and vice versa. Distracted driving is characterized by driver interference, driver mobile use and some entertainment aspects, while specific harmful and risky actions are considered for aggressive driving. High-resolution and real-time kinematic parameters of taxis were recorded by the in-vehicle recorder VBOX for overall 562 trips. The distracted driving parameters and aggressive driving actions were monitored through python data collector web application that was specially programmed for this particular research. Besides dual dash cam (i.e., front and inside car camera), drivers’ whole day driving history from their Chinese ride-hailing DiDi smart application was used to differentiate occupied trips, unoccupied trips with ride-order and unoccupied trips without ride-order. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is practiced in this paper to understand the influence of distracted driving indicators on aggressive driving behaviors. The multi-group model analysis of SEM indicated that handling distracted risky driving could control aggressive driving behavior up to 96% and 98% in unoccupied without ride-order trips and unoccupied trips with ride-order respectively. The model has also identified the sensitive risky driving indicators for each group separately. © 2020 The Authors","Aggressive driving; Distracted driving; E-hailing taxi driver; Naturalistic driving; SEM, Behavioral research; Computer software; Python; Aggressive driving; Aggressive driving behaviors; Distracted driving; Driving behaviour; E-hailing taxi driver; Naturalistic driving; Risky actions; Risky driving; Structural equation models; Taxi drivers; Taxicabs",English,Article,250,4,Mobility and Transportation

Here, we characterized the microbial resistome in relatively pristine soil samples collected from four distinct habitats on the Tibetan Plateau, using a Smart chip based high-throughput qPCR approach. We compared these to soils from the same habitats that had been subjected to various anthropogenic activities, including residential sewage discharge, animal farming, atmospheric deposition, and tourism activity. Compared to pristine samples, an average of 23.7% more ARGs were detected in the human-affected soils, and the ARGs enriched in these soils mainly encoded resistances to aminoglycoside and beta-lactam. Of the four habitats studied, soils subjected to animal farming showed the highest risks of ARG enrichment and dissemination. As shown, the number of ARGs enriched (a total of 42), their fold changes (17.6 fold on average), and the co-occurrence complexity between ARGs and mobile genetic elements were all the highest in fecal-polluted soils. As well as antibiotics themselves, heavy metals also influenced ARG distributional patterns in Tibetan environments. However, compared to urban areas, the Tibetan Plateau had a low potential for ARG selection and exhibited low carriage of ARGs by mobile genetic elements, even in environments impacted by humans, suggesting that these ARGs have a limited capacity to disseminate. The present study examined the effects of multiple anthropogenic activities on the soil resistomes in relatively pristine environments. © 2021","Animal farming; Anthropogenic activity; Antibiotic resistance gene; Resistome risk; Tibetan plateau, Animals; Anthropogenic Effects; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Tibet; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Animals; Antibiotics; DNA; Ecosystems; Heavy metals; Meteorological problems; Polymerase chain reaction; Sewage; Soil pollution; antiinfective agent; Anthropogenic activity; Antibiotic resistance; Antibiotic resistance genes; Atmospheric depositions; Genetic elements; Pristine environments; Sewage discharges; Tourism activities; antibiotic resistance; complexity; enrichment; fecal coliform; human activity; livestock farming; pollution incidence; pollution monitoring; polymerase chain reaction; soil analysis; soil pollution; animal; bacterial gene; human; microbiology; soil; Tibet; Soils",English,Article,248,3,Urban Sustainability

PPT is designated to serve passengers with long travel distances, connecting two transport hubs with few intermediate stops. We focus on the bimodal system of FRT and PPT, formulating the joint design problem as a mixed-integer program through a parsimonious continuum model. The relative location between FRT and PPT stations varies over space, which complicates route choice analysis. We overcome the challenge by approximating the costs to access transit stations at an aggregate origin-destination level. This is validated by Monte Carlo simulation. Our findings show that the proposed system is both more cost-efficient and eco-friendly than the regular system in cities with high travel demand. However, its performance deteriorates as demand drops.

A random forest model was used to analyze the nonlinear correlation between quantitative indicators and public scores, and an analysis and prediction model suitable for assessing the visual quality of an urban river on-water landscape was developed. This model provided high prediction accuracy and could rank the importance of the impact factors. The urban construction level, destructive index, hard revetment visibility, and green visibility index substantially affected the visual quality of the on-water landscape. The green visibility index was positively correlated, and the other three factors were negatively correlated with the visual quality.

56442019700,Smart growth and travel behavior—A synthesis with a focus on the United States,2022,"The contemporary society faces many challenges such as climate change, loss of natural recourses, pollutions, traffic congestion, obesity, and inequality. They are associated with sprawling land use developments that have been the dominant pattern in the United States and across the globe for several decades. On the contrary, smart growth promotes compact development, infill development or redevelopment in existing neighborhoods, mixed-use development, high accessibility supported by multimodal transportation options, and open spaces and the natural environment. Smart growth has significant impacts on people's travel behavior. Empirical studies from the United States and other countries showed that adopting the smart growth principles on land use patterns and transportation could reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and auto dependency through shorter travel distance and mode shifts. With compact and mixed-use developments, destinations are closer to origins and each other, thus travel distances are shorter. With developments toward well-connected streets with multimodal transportation services, walking, cycling, and taking transit become viable options. The mode choice starts to shift from dominantly driving to these alternative modes. Despite the transportation and other benefits that it has, smart growth faces many challenges in practice, such as consumer preferences, mixed information, lack of tools. With the intensification of climate change and other crises we are facing today, it becomes urgent to overcome these challenges to implement smart growth principles more widely across the globe. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",", Built environment; D-variables; Mixed-use development; Smart growth; Transit; Travel behavior; VMT; Walking and cycling",English,Book chapter,230,4,Mobility and Transportation

This article aims to analyse the possibility to produce smart maps from remotely sensed image classification in rapid way: The attention is focalized on different methods that are compared to identify fast and accurate procedure for producing up-To-date and reliable maps. Landsat 8 OLI multispectral images of northern Sicily (Italy) are submitted to various classification algorithms to distinguish water, bare soil and vegetation.

Using test sites, confusion matrix is built for each method, and quality indices are calculated to compare the results. Experiments demonstrate that NDVI submitted to k-means algorithm allows the best performance for distinguishing not only vegetation areas but also water bodies and bare soils.

56404574600; 57552513100,Debunking the Smuggler-Terrorist Nexus: Human Smuggling and the Islamic State in the Middle East,2022,"Amid increasing terrorist violence in and beyond European countries, concerns have been raised about connections between illegal migration and terrorism. Regional armed conflicts in the Middle East have led to the massive migration of people in search of safe heavens and better livelihoods, pressing upon frontline countries in the Mediterranean and throughout the EU. Multiple government and intelligence agencies report that human smuggling networks have been identified as providing a readily available conduit through which terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and Al-Qaida can enter Europe and the U.S. These criminal travel networks are said to rely on highly effective transnational alliances involving service providers within source, transit and destination countries. There is also widespread consensus in the intelligence circles that terrorist groups rely on the practice of smuggling for financing of terrorist activity. Nonetheless, despite the region’s geopolitical significance and its demonstrated potential for spillover effects, scant systematic field research has been conducted by independent researchers to understand the purported nexus between terrorism and human smugglers within the Middle East into the Mediterranean. This constitutes a severe gap in knowledge which our study will address. In this paper, we debunk the nexus human smuggling-terrorism by comparing the Islamic State’s logistics with human smuggling networks’ modus operandi and organizational structures. Based on a mixed research approach that combines the analysis of a unique date-set (U.S. Special Forces) and an empirical research carried out among smugglers and migrants in the Middle East and across the Eastern Mediterranean route over the past two years, this paper will tackle the alleged connection between human smuggling and terrorist groups. What will be argued is that smuggling networks and terrorist networks have fundamental operational and structural differences. These operational and structural differences need to be taken into account in order to deconstruct harmful stereotypes on irregular migration and, consequently, develop adequate responses to analytically distinct phenomena. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,English,Article,319,11,Rural Resource Management
57354325200; 35502942100; 57195034044,A composite index to measure smartness and competitiveness of heritage tourism destination and historic building,2021,"The key issue of this current study is related to shaping the attractiveness of heritage destinations, highlighting the significance of reuse and upgrading their historical buildings to achieve a high level of competitiveness and distinctiveness through a smart approach. Some of these cultural assets and events tend to be monotonous, and not so attractive for various categories of tourists, which negatively affects investment opportunities, tourism development, and social and economic resources. Furthermore, previous works have criticized the lack of evidence to support that the structure contains critical attributes and measurement items linked to the competitiveness of smart heritage destinations. As a result, this study aims to design and develop a composite index for evaluating these destinations and their buildings, which includes nine dimensions (attributes) and a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) of intelligent performance and competitiveness, reflecting the combination and noticing the distinct perspective between them. A mixed-methods approach was used between qualitative and quantitative methods to perform content validation on the proposed index. Furthermore, a pilot study was implemented for tourism heritage destinations to improve the quality and efficiency of the proposed index. Then, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to analyze the data to develop the proposed index and measure its validity and reliability. Finally, the proposed composite index was finalized with 139 KPIs and applied to a case study (Salah ElDin Citadel). After that, we validated its utility in providing a quantitative evaluation of this heritage destination, identifying critical intervention priorities, and determining dimensions that need to be restructured. Additionally, it highlighted recommendations for future improvements to strengthen these heritage destinations to become smart heritage destinations capable of competition in the tourism sector. © 2021 by the authors.

The knowledge, together with that supplemented by questionnaire data, is used for developing an ABM that simulates tourist movements. The approach is applied for the planning of Zaolinwan Park in China. The case study suggests that the incorporation of social media could provide opportunities for an enriched understanding of tourist preference of potential customers and that the modelling of tourist movements can shed light on the planning of infrastructure (e.g., roads and alleys) and service facilities (e.g., food, shopping, and accommodation), which are essential to the functioning of tourism.

Targeted and attractive promotion of these areas can help develop alternative forms of “green tourism” and increase environmental awareness among citizens, which is particularly important and vital for the future of the planet. New technologies are a key tool for improving the experience of touring urban parks, as they can make the tour much more attractive by highlighting interesting information about the flora and fauna of the park, as well as various other points of interest. This paper presents an integrated system based on augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and data analytics methodologies, comprising both mobile and web applications, focusing on urban parks touring and management, respectively. Through the mobile app for the park visitors, an attractive, interactive touring environment is created which highlights the environmental and historical interest of those areas. At the same time, the web applications for the park managers receive and analyze visitor data to help improve the visitor experience and the overall quality of the park. Finally, the developed integrated system is evaluated to ensure that it meets all user requirements and that its usability and functional components satisfy both groups of potential users, i.e., park visitors and park managers. © 2021 by the authors.",", augmented reality; deep learning; mobile application; urban parks; web application",English,Article,213,3,Urban Sustainability

Most of them are dedicated to Curitiba, Brazil, a large city in Southern Brazil recognized since 1960s as innovative in urban planning and transportation. Three approaches are considered for modeling mobility from open data: complex network models, link stream models, and computing origin-destination in transport and traffic of vehicles. Complex network models of transportation systems reveal structures that characterize patterns in transportation. Links stream models capture the temporal behavior of transportation systems, and provide information about congestion, transfer of passengers, and bunching phenomena. Moreover, this chapter brings research on approaches for characterizing origin and destinations in public and private transport. Based on data from smart card ticketing in public transportation, relevant information is gathered about people using public transport for displacement in different hours of the day. On the other hand, taxi trips recorded during a day can characterize private transport, providing the information to map relevant flows of vehicles in a city with eventual impact on traffic. Results of origin-destination of vehicles in Oporto, Portugal, are presented. The experiences of the successful Smart City Concepts in Curitiba project are reported as well, which represents a triple helix model involving academia, public, and private sectors. Its results are discussed with emphasis on the relationship between partners and how they can be shared across different players that affect urban organization and public policies for urban areas. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

The data for this study comes from a transit on-board survey conducted in Spring 2017 for the Orlando metropolitan area. Moreover, the Smart Location Database was also integrated to investigate how land use characteristics may contribute to users' choice for access and egress modes. Separate multinomial logit models were developed to investigate the mode choice for access and egress links, respectively. Various personal, trip, and land use characteristics showed significant impacts. Particularly, trips going to airports or universities/colleges had much higher probabilities of using TNC for access and egress purposes, while sports events and medical visits were less likely to be connected through TNC services. Visitors were also less likely to start their trips with TNCs. A longer distance between the origin and the transit service showed positive impacts on the use of TNC services. Higher household income also showed a positive influence on TNC usage. In view of land use characteristics, higher employment and household entropy, and high diversity at the origin reduced the probability of using motorized modes, including TNCs, for access purposes. On the destination side, high regional diversity seemed to encourage the use of TNCs and drive alone modes for egress purposes. © 2020 Tongji University and Tongji University Press",", Access mode; Egress mode; Smart location database; Transit on-board survey; Transportation Network Companies",English,Article,265,4,Mobility and Transportation

The algorithm was developed for the project “HubChain”, which proposes an on demand system being integrated with local public transport in the Elde rural region, in northern Germany. Users can request their trips via an online platform by providing the origin and destination as well as the desired arrival or departure time. To solve the problem, ant colony optimization with penalties (ACOP), in which the ants communicate pheromones both locally and globally and meanwhile the constraints are handled by setting penalties, is developed. To validate the results, the proposed algorithm and an exact algorithm were run for multiple test scenarios using the simulation SUMO as a framework. The routes obtained with the proposed algorithm show travel times comparable to the optimal routes, yet obtained in low computation times. This allows therefore the implementation of the proposed ACOP algorithm in a dynamic booking system. © 2021 IEEE.",", Ant colony optimization; Intelligent systems; Reservation systems; Travel time; Ant colony algorithms; Capacity restriction; Computation time; Dial-a-ride problem; Exact algorithms; Meta heuristic algorithm; On-demand systems; Origin and destinations; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",English,Conference paper,164,4,Mobility and Transportation

Pokémon Go Safari Zone events have been hugely successful at attracting tourists to cities around the world. For example, in one five-day Pokémon event in Tainan, Taiwan in 2018, the daily log-in count was 250,000 per day on average, generating an estimated US$50 million in revenue for the city. In order to better understand the impacts of Pokémon and other similar events on bikeshare systems, this study examined changes in station-based bikeshare trips before and during one case study event. We divided bikeshare trips into event-related (i.e., treatment) and event-unrelated (i.e., control) groups based on whether the trips originated from rental stations near 30 scenic event-related locations. We also evaluated the event's impact on the number of trips and trip durations for different smartcard users. A difference-in-difference method was used for the analysis. The results show that this event increased bikeshare trips by 27% for trips starting from event-related rental stations. The number of riders making payment by EasyCard (a smartcard first used by Taipei Mass Rapid Transit) also increased. However, there was no significant change in the duration of bicycle rentals between different smartcard types. Understanding how this event and the associated bikeshare systems are interrelated will be helpful for city administrators seeking to provide adequate services for such events in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bikeshare; Difference-in-difference model; Event; Pokémon Go, Tainan; Taiwan; Rapid transit; Bikeshare; Case-studies; Control groups; Difference-in-differences; Difference-in-differences models; Event; Group-based; Large scale events; Pokemon go; Trip duration; cycle transport; tourist attraction; tourist destination; urban transport; Smart cards",English,Article,233,4,Mobility and Transportation

Starting from the traditional theory of dynamic capacities, those related to entrepreneurship and/or that influence the entrepreneur's capacities are identified, determining factors such as training, experience and confidence. In addition, other factors such as the environmental and institutional environment have been taken into account as they affect the entrepreneurship. For this purpose, a study was carried out with the Smart PLS software in a sample of companies in the tourism sector in the Mar Menor Region (Spain). An essential factor in the development of entrepreneurship in the region is the sustainability of the coastal lagoon. Some considerations are obtained from the study of the factors that determine the model of capacities, in which the confidence of the entrepreneur and the environmental sustainability, exert a positive and significant influence in the business performance.

It is the East China Sea and the adjacent Northwest Pacific that have a major impact on China’s climate, and they have become a global concern in recent years. The seawater temperature of each sea layer influences each other. The ocean can transfer the heat accumulated through the heat exchange of the ocean air to the atmosphere, and promote the movement of the atmosphere through path changes. Heat affects the circulation of the atmosphere, thereby affecting climate change. The regulation of seawater temperature is an important item in oceanographic research, which can directly reflect global climate change and the distribution of the overall characteristics of the global ocean. In some areas, the level of surface temperature depends on the surface temperature and the geographical distribution of the area. Therefore, accurate measurement of sea surface temperature is very important for ocean temperature research and has a wide range of practical value. Starting from innovative urban tourism resources, we will explore the current status of tourism resource development, such as innovation and entrepreneurship, humanities and history, natural landscapes, and facilities. It is convenient for unique city trips in characteristic towns of coastal cities. In other words, tourism functions and community characteristics are unified, and organic functions and industrial characteristics and functional complexity overlap.

57274902400; 6701883859,Inequity evaluation for land use and transportation model on introduction of autonomous vehicles,2021,"In recent times, there have been rapid advancements in technologies that can bring about fully autonomous driving. This can potentially result in substantial changes in the road network and traffic operations. People previously not being able to travel frequently (e.g., the elderly and people with disabilities) will be able to commute themselves. Due to this intuitive property of autonomous vehicles, additional trip production may produce an impact on travel costs between some origin-destination pairs. These unwanted changes create both positive and negative impacts on the network users resulting in an inequity issue. It is necessary to evaluate the inequity caused to a whole society by providing benefits through autonomous driving to a certain group of people. In the above context, this paper uses a bi-level optimization model technique to find an optimal solution of a multi-objective function. The proposed model aims to evaluate the maximum growth of trips that a network can support without causing inequity to other network users. The upper level of the model maximizes the generation of trips constrained by the inequity parameters, whereas the lower level minimizes the travel equilibrium costs for all the users by assigning trips to the network following the multinomial logit principle. The solution to the proposed model is provided by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.","Autonomous vehicles; Genetic algorithm; Inequity; Optimization, Genetic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Land use; Motor transportation; Traffic control; Autonomous driving; Bi-level optimization models; Multi-objective functions; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Origin-destination pairs; People with disabilities; Traffic operation; Transportation model; Autonomous vehicles",English,Conference paper,216,4,Mobility and Transportation

The local administration looks to establish a collaborative network, where stakeholders take a crucial role. The research aims to appeal to the accommodations and food services stakeholders to have a shared vision of the issues and priorities related to sustainable tourism development. Their perception is a critical factor in making decisions regarding the region’s competitiveness. Algarve’s two major and leading associations of the tourism supply sector AIHSA and AHETA were invited to participate in the study. Based on the responses of an online questionnaire, an artificial intelligence algorithm was applied to the data to identify the common and divergent aspects. The conceptual model developed is based on a simplified model of psychological ownership. The results highlight a convergent perspective regarding sustainability challenges, namely, natural resources and biodiversity, safety, and supply chain. However, hotels and restaurants do not reflect the same perception regarding sustainability initiatives, e-tourism, or free internet access.

Historically, developing human civilizations have often settled in coastal areas with about 2/3 of the human population inhabiting areas within 20-km range from coastal areas. Environmental management worldwide strives for sustainable development while minimizing impacts to ecosystem integrity and has resulted in several framework directives, management programs, and legislation compelling governments to monitor their coastal systems and improve environmental quality. Among the most significant anthropogenic impacts to these ecosystems are land reclamation, dredging, pollution (sediment discharges, hazardous substances, litter, oil spills, and eutrophication), unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (sand extraction, oil and gas exploitation, and fishing), unmanaged tourism activities, the introduction of non-indigenous species, and climate change. The multitude of stressors is not independent, and as such, the chemical status of marine systems has serious implications on its ecological status and needs to be addressed efficiently. Public monitoring databases provide a large amount of physico-chemical (nutrient, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a concentration) and contaminant (trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) data for all Portuguese transitional systems (estuaries and coastal lagoons). These data are used to classify the chemical status (eutrophication and contamination level) of these ecosystems considering pre-defined classification thresholds, which facilitates communication to government authorities and management entities. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques provide an automated and efficient opportunity to improve simulation accuracy and further advance our understanding of environmental problems in estuarine and coastal waters when dealing with large environmental datasets. In the present work, we applied machine learning models, namely, linear discriminant analysis, classification tree, naive Bayesian, and support vector machine, to nutrient, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, trace metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations to produce a chemical status classification of the Portuguese marine transition systems. This approach allowed us to efficiently classify in an automated way the transitional water’s chemical status within the pre-defined classification thresholds, producing numerical index values that can easily be communicated to the general public and managers alike. © Copyright © 2021 Concepcion, Dadios, Bandala, Caçador, Fonseca and Duarte.",", classification; computational intelligence; estuarine systems; eutrophication; machine learning; water contamination",English,Article,342,11,Rural Resource Management

The biodiversity and the richness of resources are the foundation for storing tourism resources, water resources, and mineral resources. These abundant resources in the mountains also provide a good ecosystem for the surrounding areas and optimize the ecological environment of the surrounding areas. But the mountain ecosystem is actually very fragile. It can be compared to the engine of global climate change.

In particular the proposed model considers automated carriages that can virtually split and merge together to form a train with a time-varying composition and capacity. Moreover, each carriage is associated to a destination, so that a train can be composed by different carriages, each of them capable of independently taking a different direction at a junction. This work describes a novel optimization model, based on an integer mathematical programming formulation, aimed to determine the optimal paths and departure times of the carriages in a urban railway network, and thus the optimal time-variant capacity along the path between each pair origin-destination, according to transport demand and in particular minimizing the necessity for the passengers to change train in order to reach their destination. In order to allow trains to change their composition, some maneuvers at the stations are assumed to be possible, like the parking of unused carriages on a side track and the change of track allowed by appropriate switches. The paper presents also some results of the implementation of the model on an example case study, with the aim of testing the model and discussing some features of the solution. © 2021 IEEE.","Automated trains; On-demand railway services; Public transport management; Virtual coupling, Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Railroads; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Departure time; Optimal time-variant; Optimization modeling; Origin destination; Railway services; Split-and-merge; Transport demand; Virtual coupling; Railroad transportation",English,Conference paper,223,4,Mobility and Transportation
57212413544,Using data on bike-sharing system user stopovers in smart tourism: A case study,2021,"Bike-sharing systems are an important element in development of the smart cities and datasets from these systems are one of the ways to obtain large amount of information on bicycle traffic. These usually contain data on the origin and destination of each trip, as well as its time and duration. Alongside the basic data, some operators also provide information on the exact route picked by each user. This allows researchers to study stopovers, which may serve as a source of interesting information on human behaviour in public spaces and, as a consequence, help improve its analysis and design. However, using the raw data may lead to important errors because most stops occur in the vicinity of bike stations or are related to traffic problems, as evidenced by the case study of Cracow. The data filtering method proposed below opens up the possibility for using such datasets for further research on bike user behaviour and public spaces. © 2021 University of Zilina.

Origin–destination (O–D) estimation has been recognized as a requisite step before utilizing the smart card data to investigate transit passengers’ spatiotemporal dynamics or conduct other SC data-based transit modeling. In the recent decade, the extant literature has proposed various trip-chain-based methods for transit O-D estimation using SC data. However, one problem of the conventional trip-chaining estimation approach has been noticed but not paid enough attention to: O-D estimation of single transactions cannot be conducted since the trip-chain method generally requires at least two trip records per day to proceed with. Such a flaw in the classic trip-chain approach might lead to a considerable amount of data loss and inaccurate O-D estimation. This paper improved the existing trip-chain O-D estimation method by introducing a new framework based on the Minimum Entropy Rate (MER) criterion. The proposed MER-based method adopts a similar mechanism of noise reduction in information theory. The basic idea of our approach is to infer the alighting location of single trips using alternative stops that preserve passengers’ travel regularity exhibiting in their mobility sequences. Our enhanced approach can estimate alighting stops for single trips with decent accuracy, thus preventing a potential massive data loss. Moreover, the study also provides an in-depth insight into the relationship between entropy rates estimated using trip sequences and passengers’ travel regularity. The estimation results can further benefit future transit studies with reliable data sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Entropy rate; O-D estimation; Public transportation; Smart card data; Travel regularity; Travel sequence, Entropy; Information theory; Noise abatement; Data-source; Entropy rates; O-D estimation; Origin destination; Public transportation; Smart card data; Transit passenger; Travel regularity; Travel sequence; Trip chains; public transport; transportation technology; travel behavior; Smart cards",English,Article,256,4,Mobility and Transportation
57202434150; 6507307183,Dynamic pricing for ride-hailing services considering relocation and mode choice,2021,"Ride hailing services are gaining popularity in cities around the world, and the introduction of shared autonomous vehicles is likely to pronounce this trend. A problem with these services is the extra travel to relocate without customers, necessary to serve an asymmetric demand. One solution to reduce the amount of empty driving is the adoption of an optimized pricing strategy that takes into account the cost of relocation. In this work, we present a dynamic pricing optimization that is integrated with online predictive relocation. We simulate the choice between a service that is operated between densely distributed demand points with shared autonomous vehicles and a generic alternative mode. The strategy finds optimal fares for each origin/destination area in each period of the day to maximize net profits for the operator. Our approach is flexible, fast, and scalable. We demonstrate our proposed methodology with a large dataset of taxi trips from New York City. The results of the simulations show that our pricing strategy consistently increases the operator’s revenues and decreases relocation costs when compared to the case with an optimal but constant, distance dependent fare. In cases where passengers’ waiting times are significant, our approach also significantly reduces average wait times, thus benefiting passengers too. © 2021 IEEE.","Autonomous vehicles; Economics; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Large dataset; Taxicabs; Asymmetric demands; Dynamic pricing; Mode choice; Net profits; New York city; Pricing strategy; Relocation costs; Waiting time; Costs, Dynamic pricing; Ride hailing; Shared transportation",English,Conference paper,208,4,Mobility and Transportation
57190300122; 56044057700,Evaluating onboard multitasking on mode choice: Conventional car and autonomous vehicle,2021,"Travelers try to conduct onboard activities during traveling to decrease the negative impact of travel time. This research paper studied the impact of multitasking availability on the travel behavior of people onboard of autonomous vehicle (AV) and conventional car (CAR). Several studies focused mainly on the travel behavior of people onboard of conventional transport modes (CTMs) rather than AV because the last is not still on the market. Besides, a scarcity in studies that concern multitasking in AV is noticed. In this paper impacts of multitasking on the travel behavior were covered concerning two transport modes, CAR, and shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) where only the main destinations of travelers inside urban areas are considered. A discrete choice experiment was prepared and followed by a stated preference (SP) survey. A sample size of 2008 observations was collected. Panel data-Mixed Logit (ML) and Multinomial Logit (MNL) models were examined including the travel cost, travel time, and multitasking availability. The results are, the value of travel time (VOT) of SAV is lower than CAR, the multitasking availability increases the probability of being in a transport mode, and the impact of multitasking in SAV is higher than CAR. Thus, people tend to choose SAV over CAR to maximize the utilities when the multitasking availability is considered. © 2021 European Union.","Autonomous vehicle; Multitasking; Onboard activities; Travel behavior; Value of travel time, Behavioral research; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Multitasking; Travel time; Urban transportation; Conventional transports; Discrete choice experiments; Multinomial Logit; On-board activities; Research papers; Stated preference surveys; Transport modes; Travel behaviors; Autonomous vehicles",English,Conference paper,216,4,Mobility and Transportation

Many fundamental analyses of transportation systems rely on the origin–destination demand matrix of the network. Although extraction of origin–destination travel demand for public transportation networks from ticketing data is not a new problem, yet it entails challenges, such as ‘alighting transaction inference’ and ‘transfer identification’ which are worthy of further attention. This is mainly because the state-of-the-art solutions to these challenges, are often heavily reliant on network-specific expert knowledge and extensive parameter setting, or multiple data sources. In this paper, we propose a procedure that effectively applies statistical pattern recognition techniques to address the main challenges in extracting the origin–destination demand from passenger smartcard records. Learning from patterns in the available data allows the procedure to perform well under minimum case-specific assumptions, thus it becomes applicable to smartcard data from various public transportation systems. The performance of the proposed framework is tested on a dataset of over 100 million smartcard transaction records from Melbourne's multi-modal public transportation network. Evaluations on different aspects of the proposed procedure, suggest that the identified tasks are well addressed, and the framework is able to extract an accurate estimation of the origin–destination demand matrix for the system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]; Data mining; Extraction; Matrix algebra; Pattern recognition; Automated extraction; Destination inference; matrix; Origin destination; Origin destination matrices; Passenger travel demand; Public transportation networks; Smartcard datum; Transfer identification; Trip chaining; demand analysis; network analysis; pattern recognition; public transport; transportation development; transportation planning; travel demand; Smart cards, Destination inference; Origin–destination matrix; Passenger travel demand; Pattern recognition; Public transportation network; Smartcard data; Transfer identification; Trip chaining",English,Article,209,4,Mobility and Transportation

While there are many tools which could be implemented for such endeavors, the evaluation of the tourist preferences in relation to their use and importance needs to be done so as to ensure at least the sustainability of investments and of the local development strategies. The Chimborazo Fauna Reserve (canton of Riobamba, Ecuador) was selected for the application of a questionnaire survey to evaluate the importance of 38 smart tourism tools based on the experience of Ecuadorian and international tourists with them. The survey considered more than 700 respondents and 500 valid questionnaires were retained for analysis which was done mainly by developing distributions of the relative fre-quencies of ratings given on a 5-point Likert scale and by a correspondence analysis at the level of two subsamples: national and international tourists. There were obvious differences between these two groups in terms of importance placed on the smart tourism tools. The first difference was that the Ecuadorian tourists found less utility in the smart tools as compared to the international tourists. The second difference was that the best rated tools in terms of importance were different among the two groups, with the international tourists placing, for instance, more importance on safety-related tools. Correspondence analysis has shown the similarities of profiles and data association, being a useful tool of associating the ratings to the evaluated tools. The knowledge gained by the survey may be helpful in supporting the development of local tourist strategies, providing at the same time valuable data to support preference comparisons with other tourist destinations and countries. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we propose a three-stage method for short-term forecasts on individual accessibility in bus system based on neural network (NN) model. In the first stage, a NN model is designed to tackle the nonlinear mapping between passengers' bus trip appearances in historical periods and those in the predicted period. A rate function, which considers bus trip generation rates of passengers, is then applied using outputs of the designed NN model. In the second stage, probabilities of origin-destinations (ODs) chosen by passengers in the predicted period are calculated. In the third stage, land use information combined with results of previous two stages are used to obtain the individual accessibility in bus system in the predicted period. Compared to individual accessibility calculated by real data, it is found that the average errors of predicted results by the proposed method in weekdays and at weekends are only 8.37% and 10.13%, respectively. The results also demonstrate the capability of combining a NN model, traffic data and land use information to forecast the future spatial distribution of individual accessibility in transport system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bus system; Individual accessibility; Neural network model; Points of interest; Smart card records, accessibility; artificial neural network; bus transport; forecasting method; historical record; model; travel behavior",English,Article,205,4,Mobility and Transportation

Three quarters of tourists travel to and from Austria by car and approximately 10% by plane, contributing significantly to the sector's GHG emissions. Should pre-COVID 19 trends continue, an expansion of further distant home markets and an increase of guests arriving by plane can be expected. Low-carbon technologies, intelligent mobility management and societal trends towards shared mobility solutions can improve the environmental performance of tourist travel but will not suffice to achieve the Paris Agreement's climate targets. Further strong incentives will be necessary to avoid these unsustainable forms of mobility and shift trips to climate-friendly modes of transport and the number and distance of tourism trips can be reduced by focussing marketing on closer rather than long-distance home markets and promotion of longer stays. Local tourism stakeholders in Austria can contribute by awareness-raising campaigns and promoting sustainable mobility solutions at the destinations. Politics need enable this shift by setting framework conditions such as full incorporation of climate costs for all modes of travel. Management implications: To reduce travel related GHG emissions significantly, tourism cannot only rely on technological solutions (electric vehicles) and trends (sharing) but must also initiate a shift from air and private road transport to rail and public transport. This requires measures that offer incentives (fast and direct train and bus connections, climate-friendly local transport, luggage services, attractive all-in packages, etc.), but also a focus on closer rather than long-distance home markets, promotion of longer stays and awareness-raising campaigns for local stakeholders and tourists. The awareness created by the COVID-19 and climate crises can be seen as an opportunity to take these measures. © 2021 The Authors",", Behavioural change, Covid 19; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Mobility; Tourism; Tourist travel",English,Article,325,11,Rural Resource Management

Due to the ongoing development and expansion of Bangkok, urbanization has continued to expand into adjacent provinces, creating the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR). Continuous monitoring of human mobility in BMR aids in public transport planning and design, and efficient performance assessment. The purpose of this study is to design and develop a process to derive human mobility patterns from the real movement of people who use both fixed-route and non-fixed-route public transport modes, including taxis, vans, and electric rail. Taxi GPS open data were collected by the Intelligent Traffic Information Center Foundation (iTIC) from all GPS-equipped taxis of one opera-tor in BMR. GPS probe data of all operating GPS-equipped vans were collected by the Ministry of Transport’s Department of Land Transport for daily speed and driving behavior monitoring. Fi-nally, the ridership data of all electric rail lines were collected from smartcards by the Automated Fare Collection (AFC). None of the previous works on human mobility extraction from multi-sourced big data have used van data; therefore, it is a challenge to use this data with other sources in the study of human mobility. Each public transport mode has traveling characteristics unique to its passengers and, therefore, specific analytical tools. Firstly, the taxi trip extraction process was developed using Hadoop Hive to process a large quantity of data spanning a one-month period to derive the origin and destination (OD) of each trip. Secondly, for van data, a Java program was used to construct the ODs of van trips. Thirdly, another Java program was used to create the ODs of the electric rail lines. All OD locations of these three modes were aggregated into transportation analysis zones (TAZ). The major taxi trip destinations were found to be international airports and provincial bus terminals. The significant trip destinations of vans were provincial bus terminals in Bangkok, electric rail stations, and the industrial estates in other provinces of BMR. In contrast, electric rail destinations were electric rail line interchange stations, the central business district (CBD), and commercial office areas. Therefore, these significant destinations of taxis and vans should be considered in electric rail planning to reduce the air pollution from gasoline vehicles (taxis and vans). Using the designed procedures, the up-to-date dataset of public transport can be pro-cessed to derive a time series of human mobility as an input into continuous and sustainable public transport planning and performance assessment. Based on the results of the study, the procedures can benefit other cities in Thailand and other countries. © 2021 by the authors.

It is generally expected to improve vehicle utilization rate, and therefore alleviate traffic congestion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. A few recent theoretical studies are conducted, mainly focusing on the equilibrium analysis of the ride-sourcing markets with ride-pooling services and the impacts of ride-pooling services on transit ridership and traffic congestion. In these studies, there are three key measures that distinguish ride-pooling service analysis from the non-pooling ride-sourcing market analysis. The first is the proportion of passengers who are pool-matched(referred to as pool-matching probability), the second is passengers’ average detour distance, and the third is average vehicle routing distance to pick up and drop off all passengers with different origins and destinations in one specific ride. These three measures are determined by passenger demand for ride-pooling and matching strategies. However, due to the complex nature of ride-resourcing market, it is difficult to analytically determine the relationships between these measures and passenger demand. To fill this research gap, this paper attempts to empirically ascertain these relationships through extensive experiments based on the actual on-demand mobility data obtained from Chengdu, Haikou, and Manhattan. We are surprised to find that the relationships between the three measures (pool-matching probability, passengers’ average detour distance, average vehicle routing distance) and number of passengers in the matching pool (which reflects passenger demand) can be fitted by some simple curves (with fairly high goodness-of-fit) or there exist elegant empirical laws on these relationships. Our findings are insightful and useful to theoretical modeling and applications in ride-resourcing markets, such as evaluation of the impacts of ride-pooling on transit usage and traffic congestion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chengdu; China; Haikou; Hainan; Kansas; Manhattan; Sichuan; United States; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Global warming; Lakes; Probability; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Carbon dioxide emissions; Data-driven analysis; Equilibrium analysis; Passenger demands; Theoretical modeling; Theoretical study; Transit riderships; Vehicle utilization; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; probability; traffic congestion; Traffic congestion, Detour distance; Matching probability; Ride-pooling; Ride-sourcing; Routing distance",English,Article,292,4,Mobility and Transportation

57161547100; 57214898932,Hailing a change: comparing taxi and ridehail service quality in Los Angeles,2021,"For decades, taxis have provided for-hire vehicle service without significant competition from other modes. But in 2012, ride-hail services such as Uber and Lyft upended the taxi business model by connecting riders to drivers through smartphone applications. Since then, few studies have considered how taxis compare to their new competition or how service quality varies across the two modes. We use data from 1680 ride-hail and taxi trips taken in a Los Angeles audit study to ask: how do service qualities—including trip price, reliability, and accountability—vary across ride-hailing (Uber and Lyft) and taxis? We find that, for the same origin and destination pair, ridehail users pay 40% lower fares and wait about one-quarter of the time compared to taxis. In addition, ride-hailing nearly guaranteed a ride, while about one in five taxi riders were never picked up. We utilize semi-structured interviews of frequent taxi and ride-hail users to examine potential explanations of the stark quantitative differences observed across modes. Findings reveal that, despite technological disruption, travelers continue to prioritize the long-standing tenets of transportation services: affordability, reliability, and accountability. Ride-hailing successfully implemented technologies to deliver on these traveler priorities, while taxis have largely failed to capitalize on new technologies. Findings suggest that taxis will need to do more than lower prices or put more cars on the road if they hope to compete with ride-hailing services, and that both new and old modes should harness technology to deliver on long-standing transportation service goals. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","California; Los Angeles [California]; United States; Precipitation (meteorology); Quality of service; Reliability; Business modeling; Origin and destinations; Semi structured interviews; Service Quality; Smart-phone applications; Taxi; Transportation network; Transportation services; comparative study; public transport; quantitative analysis; reliability analysis; service quality; taxi transport; Taxicabs, Ride-hail; Service quality; Taxi; Transportation network company; Travel reliability",English,Article,253,4,Mobility and Transportation

To counteract these problems, a new paradigm is necessary which promotes alternative mobility services. ‘Smart mobility’ refers to a new mobility behaviour that makes use of innovative technical solutions, such as the IT-supported combination of different alternative mobility services during a trip from an origin to a destination. Unfortunately, relatively few customers use apps that provide recommendations for smart mobility and there is limited knowledge about the desires, priorities and needs of potential customers. To fill this gap, we use conjoint analysis to explore differences in smart mobility app preferences across groups of people with varying mobility behaviour. Our study also considers the effect of age and place of residence on preference structures. Our results show, for example, that only car drivers do not consider the price of the smart mobility app to be particularly important for their selection decision. © 2020, The Author(s).",", Conjoint analysis; Mobility as a service (MaaS); Monetization; Preference structure; Smart mobility",English,Article,159,4,Mobility and Transportation

This study analyses the domestic tourists' choice and their pattern of needs of transportation mode in Bali as the case study. The developed models are based on utility maximisation of underlying preferences for each of the available modes of transport. Domestic tourists are randomly selected and interviewed using the questionnaire to record their daily trips. The study result indicates that income, number of visits and travel companions significantly influence the choice of transportation mode for domestic tourists. Meanwhile, income, number of visits, length of stays, trip purpose and main issues in selecting local transport mode significantly affect the pattern of needs of transportation mode for domestic tourists. For example, two accompanying persons will be three times more than that of seven persons or more to choose motorcycle and bus than a car. Domestic tourists who have visited Bali twice will be three times more than those who visited Bali once to use travel agents and rented vehicles than public and online transport and others.

The main results can be summarized as follows. Since 2000, obvious differences in urban growth and shrinkage have occurred in Northeast China. Some 42.85% of cities showed an urban shrinkage. The manufacturing and service industries in cities of urban growth (growing cities) are increasingly advanced, while the development of new pattern industries and industrial structure upgrading are slow in cities of urban shrinkage (shrinking cities) and the economic competitiveness of these shrinking cities is weakening. There is a close spatial correlation between growing and shrinking cities. On the one hand, growing cities continuously absorb the production factors such as population and capital of shrinking cities through the agglomeration effect, and on the other hand, they increase the pressure of economic transformation of shrinking cities through the spatial transfer of traditional industries. The shrinkage degree varies from high to low from north to south, and shows a trend of 'first strengthening, then weakening' from east to west. The processing cities have the highest shrinkage degree, followed by industrial and mining cities, and the tourism and port cities have a relatively low shrinkage degree. The factors influencing urban shrinkage include the development lag of public service facilities, the misalignment of industrial development and market demand, the low correlation degree of industrial structure, the aging of population structure, and the agglomeration effect of regional central places, their intensity of action enhancing in turn. According to the economic long wave theory and local circumstances, Northeast China will experience a long-term urban shrinkage in the future. It should be a strategic choice to develop this region to actively adapt to the shrinkage, and optimize and reorganize population and economic factors through smart urban shrinkage. © 2021, Science Press.

14031080700,A predictive vehicle ride sharing recommendation system for smart cities commuting,2021,"Smart Cities (or Cities 2.0) are an evolution in citizen habitation. In such cities, trans-port commuting is changing rapidly with the proliferation of contemporary vehicular technology. New models of vehicle ride sharing systems are changing the way citizens commute in their daily movement schedule. The use of a private vehicle per single passenger transportation is no longer viable in sustainable Smart Cities (SC) because of the vehicles’ resource allocation and urban pollution. The current research on car ride sharing systems is widely expanding in a range of contemporary technologies, however, without covering a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper, the focus is on performing a multidisciplinary research on car riding systems taking into consideration personalized user mobility behavior by providing next destination prediction as well as a recommender system based on riders’ personalized information. Specifically, it proposes a predictive vehicle ride sharing system for commuting, which has impact on the SC green ecosystem. The adopted system also provides a recommendation to citizens to select the persons they would like to commute with. An Ar-tificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled weighted pattern matching model is used to assess user movement behavior in SC and provide the best predicted recommendation list of commuting users. Citizens are then able to engage a current trip to next destination with the more suitable user provided by the list. An experimented is conducted with real data from the municipality of New Philadelphia, in SC of Athens, Greece, to implement the proposed system and observe certain user movement behavior. The results are promising for the incorporation of the adopted system to other SCs. © 2021 by the author.

The paper collects data provided by the Smart Specialisation Platform (Eye@RIS3) from 2013 to 2018 for 191 EU regions to investigate regional determinants affecting the probability to choose tourism as one of their S3 priorities. Results show that tourism is considered as priority for almost half EU regions of the sample and that these regions have not homogeneous characteristics. Tourism represents the strategic choice of already developed tourism destinations as well as regions with no tourism specialisation.

Although, usually, there is no transaction made at the destination stop, making some assumptions can help us infer the destination. In this study, we present an integrated procedure that can generate origin–destination matrices and passenger load profiles as essential tools for public transport planning processes. Moreover, this procedure can be used to detect and analyze trips that include transfers. In an attempt to employ the proposed algorithm in the Tehran bus rapid transit network, 52% of the transactions could be used to trace the trips in an origin–destination format. The trips that include transfers are recognized and analyzed further.

Revealing that Southern European regions are mostly following strategies of cost-leadership based on the provision of mass tourism products and services with low value-added, the results of these works also show that the long-term economic benefits of this type of path-dependence evolution are limited, both in terms of economic growth and also in terms of the socio-economic resilience of these regions when facing negative external shocks. In particular, the high importance of the tourism sector within regional processes of specialization makes them especially vulnerable both to the impacts of overtourism and no-tourism.

IO (Input-Output) tables, multipliers, and centric network were the instruments for data analysis. This study classified 180 production fields for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Ten groups of S-curve were considered in two forms as the “New Engine of Growth.” The first five S-curves consisted of next-generation automotive; smart electronics; affluent, medical, and wellness tourism; agriculture and biotechnology; and food for the future. The second five S-curves consisted of robotics, aviation and logistics, biofuels and biochemicals; digital; and medical hubs as representatives of future industries in Thailand. The findings revealed that according to IO analysis, the first S-curve mostly relied on fertilizer and pesticides and wholesale trade. Subsequently, the outputs were distributed to restaurants and drinking places, i.e., coffee and tea cafes. The second S-curves mostly relied on petroleum refineries and petroleum and natural gas. The outputs from the latter were distributed to radio, television, and related services. According to multiplier analysis, it was found that for all ten groups, the components of future industries in Thailand had higher multipliers from 2000 to 2015. This described increasing output changes that occurred in all production fields. More specifically, the highest multiplier in 2015 was robotics, implying the most economic impact when robotics changed. © The Authors, (2021).

Sustainability has been on and off the city marketing agenda, almost exclusively in its environmental dimension. In this article, we examine the current representations of Berlin as a “sustainable city” in the official city marketing strategies. We look at how sustainability is used and instrumentalized to create a specific city profile and also to attract particular target groups in tourism. We propose an analysis of sustainable planning in Berlin since reunification to show how it has moved into different directions over time and how this has (or has not) been followed by city marketing. In this endeavor, we move between the existing, and as we argue deeper and more sophisticated, environmental planning of the city on one hand, and the reductions and simplifications of city marketing representations on the other. Finally, we argue that there are inherent contradictions in marketing a sustainable city, where both in terms of tourism and economic development, the concept of growth seems to be reaching environmental limits. © 2021 by the authors.

Research methods. The methodological basis of the study were the provisions of economic theory and systems analysis. The stages of development of cannabis were considered using the historical method. The dynamics of sown areas was studied using the statistical and economic method. Using a logical method, the tools (methods) of strategic management in the field of cannabis were evaluated on the example of the Institute of Bast Cultures of NAAS of Ukraine and the main directions of strategic management development. The method of analysis and synthesis was used to identify opportunities to expand the tools of strategic management (agricultural cluster as a consequence of the use of an innovative European tool-smart specialization). Theoretical generalizations to substantiate the use of existing and innovative tools of strategic management and conclusions were formed using the abstract-logical method. Research results. The historical key moments that influenced the development of the cannabis industry over the last hundred years are highlighted. The inefficiency of the traditional top-down management strategy is proved and a new tool of strategic management of the European model is substantiated-smart specialization as a basis for regional development. The algorithm of creation and efficiency of agrotourism cluster ""Slobozhanske hemp"" in Sumy region is given. The main directions of development of strategic management in the field of hemp are outlined. A SWOT analysis matrix was used to study in detail the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the cannabis industry. On the example of the Institute of Bast Crops of NAAS of Ukraine, the main tools of strategic planning were outlined and analyzed. Scientific novelty. The necessity of reorientation of the strategy of regional management from vertical (top-down) to innova-tive, local, multilevel (smart specialization) is substantiated. With the help of SWOT-analysis, it identified weaknesses and threats that prevent the defense management strategy to move to a defensive-offensive base strategy. The combination of strengths and opportunities in the long run will provide an opportunity to choose a strategy for sustainable development of the cannabis industry. The expediency of creating the Agro-tourist cluster ""Slobozhanske hemp"" in Sumy region as a powerful economic mechanism and a ""green tourist magnet"" is considered. The analysis of the main tools of strategic management of ILK NAAS of Ukraine provided an opportunity to formulate the main directions of development of strategic management in the field of hemp.

55996550200,Jordan: Background and U.S. Relations (Updated),2021,"The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a key U.S. partner in the Middle East. Although the United States and Jordan have never been linked by a formal treaty, the two countries have cooperated on a number of regional and international issues over the years. Jordan remains at peace with Israel and is a key interlocutor with the Palestinians. Jordan’s strategic importance to the United States is evident given ongoing instability in neighboring Syria and Iraq. Jordan also is a longtime U.S. partner in global counterterrorism operations. U.S.-Jordanian military, intelligence, and diplomatic cooperation seeks to empower political moderates, reduce sectarian conflict, and eliminate terrorist threats. U.S. officials frequently express their support for Jordan. U.S. support has helped Jordan address serious vulnerabilities, both internal and external. Jordan’s small size and lack of major economic resources have made it dependent on aid from Western and various Arab sources. President Trump has acknowledged Jordan’s role as a key U.S. partner in countering the Islamic State, as many U.S. policymakers advocate for continued robust U.S. assistance to the kingdom. Annual U.S. aid to Jordan has nearly quadrupled in historical terms over the last 15 years. The United States has provided economic and military aid to Jordan since 1951 and 1957, respectively. Total bilateral U.S. aid (overseen by the Departments of State and Defense) to Jordan through FY2018 amounted to approximately $22 billion. Jordan also hosts over 3, 000 U.S. troops. To date, Jordan has withstood the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with minimal loss of life (a reported nine deaths), but at a steep cost to its economy. Jordan’s small size and strong public health system arguably contributed to the country’s ability to manage the pandemic effectively. Jordan is one of the first Arab countries to reopen; as of June 2020 the state had lifted most restrictions on economic activity and certain public gatherings, such as religious worship. Analysts anticipate that Jordan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will contract in 2020 by 3.5% after growing 2% last year. Losses in government revenue caused by fewer remittances and a weakened market for tourism are expected to widen the budget deficit in the years ahead. As the Trump Administration has enacted changes to longstanding U.S. policies on Israel and the Palestinians, which the Palestinians have criticized as unfairly punitive to them and biased toward Israel, Jordan has found itself in a difficult position. While King Abdullah II seeks to maintain strong relations with the United States, he rules over a country where the issue of Palestinian rights resonates with much of the population; more than half of all Jordanian citizens originate from either the West Bank or the area now comprising the state of Israel. In trying to balance U.S.-Jordanian relations with Palestinian concerns, King Abdullah II has refrained from directly criticizing the Trump Administration on its moves, while urging the international community to return to the goal of a two-state solution that would ultimately lead to an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Jordanian leaders have expressed strong opposition to a possible Israeli cabinet and Knesset vote on annexing West Bank territory-in coordination with the United States-after July 1, 2020. King Abdullah II has signaled that should Israel go ahead with annexation, Jordan is prepared to escalate its confrontation with Israel. As Jordan considers whether to revisit its ties to Israel, the range of possible options Jordan may be considering include withdrawing its ambassador from Israel, reducing security cooperation, cancelling its natural gas deal with Israel, and either partially or fully suspending the 1994 peace treaty. Congress may consider legislation pertaining to U.S. relations with Jordan. On February 18, 2016, President Obama signed the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-123), which authorizes expedited review and an increased value threshold for proposed arms sales to Jordan for a period of three years. It amended the Arms Export Control Act to give Jordan temporarily the same preferential treatment U.S. law bestows upon NATO members and Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. S. 28, the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Extension Act, would reauthorize the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act (22 U.S.C. §275) through December 31, 2022. In the House, H.R. 4862 also would reauthorize the 2015 Act while also calling on the United States International Development Finance Corporation to issue a call for “proposals pursuing investment funds with a focus on Jordan.”. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,English,Book chapter,738,3,Urban Sustainability

Air pollution, despite the noteworthy improvements during the last decades, still plays a significant role in the quality of living in European cities as it causes damages to health and ecosystems, thus making urgent the immoderate need of diminishing it. Within the Horizon 2020 CIVITAS DESTINATIONS project, six European island cities, which are highly attractive destinations for tourists worldwide, implemented various sustainable mobility measures. Among them, Funchal, Madeira-Portugal, and Rethymno, Crete-Greece, implemented two different environmental monitoring systems to measure and calculate a predetermined set of indicators, capable of estimating the environmental benefits in transport, economy, society, energy, and the environment. The monitoring systems were installed in specific sites all around these two cities, aiming, through the integrated sensors, to collect environmental data related to transport load, such as environmental indexes (temperature, humidity, noise) and air pollutants (CO2, CO, NOx, SO2, PM). The collection of critical and reliable data offers the opportunity for an effective evaluation of the overall performance of the implemented measures toward sustainable, environmentally friendly, and low-carbon mobility policies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2022.",", Air quality; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental monitoring; Transport impacts; Urban environment",English,Book chapter,205,11,Rural Resource Management
55802919300; 38862855600,Preliminary Findings From a Pilot Study of Electric Vehicle Recharging From a Stand-Alone Solar Minigrid,2021,"The symbiosis between smart minigrids and electric mobility has the potential to improve the cost and reliability of energy access for off-grid communities while providing low-carbon transport services. This study explores the commercial viability of using electric vehicles (EVs), recharged by solar minigrids, to provide transport services in off-grid communities. Preliminary findings are presented from a field trial in The Gambia that aims to assess the techno-economic feasibility of integrating sustainable energy and transport infrastructures in sun-rich regions of the Global South. As a dispatchable anchor load, an EV can improve the technical and economic performance of a minigrid by providing demand-side response services. In the developing world, rural communities are often among the poorest, and inadequate transport services remain a major barrier to wealth-creation. Some solutions to this situation may be transferrable to island communities, which share similar challenges in terms of access to energy and fuel. The first of its kind in Africa, this field trial uses an electric minivan, operating from an off-grid village where it has access to a minigrid whose 4.5 kWp of photovoltaic modules form the roof of a parking shelter for the vehicle. While there, the taxi can recharge, ideally during sunny periods when the photovoltaic array produces surplus power, thus allowing the EV’s battery to recharge while bypassing the minigrid’s own accumulator. This improves system reliability and cost effectiveness, while providing pollution-free energy for the taxi. Ultimately, the intention is to test different vehicles in a variety of circumstances, but this paper outlines only the preliminary findings of the first of these trials. Early results provide convincing new evidence that commercial viability of such a concept is possible in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some promising scenarios for commercial viability are identified, which warrant further investigation, since they suggest that a taxi driver’s earnings could be increased between 250 and 1,300% in local operations, and even 20-fold in tourist markets, depending on vehicle type, minigrid configuration and target market. It is hoped that these may encourage the rollout of solar-recharged EVs where the nexus of sustainable energy and transport systems are likely to make the greatest contribution to addressing the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, by helping to solve the trilemma of providing energy security, social benefit and environmental sustainability in low-income countries. © Copyright © 2021 Gammon and Sallah.","Automobile testing; Commerce; Commercial vehicles; Cost effectiveness; Demand side management; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Electric automobiles; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy security; Free energy; Photovoltaic cells; Reliability; Sustainable development; Taxicabs; Commercial viability; Demand side response; Economic performance; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Environmental sustainability; Photovoltaic modules; Techno-economic feasibility; Transport infrastructure; Commercial vehicle operations, developing world; electric vehicles; international development; low-carbon transport; minigrids; smart recharging; solar energy; sub-Saharan Africa",English,Article,384,11,Rural Resource Management

Past research studies have attempted to understand the relationship between public bicycle trip generation, trip attraction and factors such as built environment, weather, population density, etc. However, these studies typically did not include trip distribution, duration, and detailed information on the built environment. This paper aims to estimate public bicycle daily trip characteristics, i.e., trip generation, trip attraction, trip distribution, and duration using points of interest and smart card data from Nanjing, China. Negative binomial regression models were developed to examine the effect of built environment on public bicycle usage. Totally fifteen types of points of interest (POIs) data are investigated and factors such as residence, employment, entertainment, and metro station are found to be statistically significant. The results showed that 300 m buffer POIs of residence, employment, entertainment, restaurant, bus stop, metro station, amenity, and school have significantly positive effects on public bicycle generation and attraction, while, counterintuitively, 300 m buffer POIs of shopping, parks, attractions, sports, and hospital have significantly negative effects. Specifically, an increase of 1% in the trip distance leads to a 2.36% decrease in the origin-destination (OD) trips or a 0.54% increase of the trip duration. We also found that a 1% increase in the number of other nearby stations can help reduce 0.19% of the OD trips. The results from this paper can offer useful insights to operators in better estimating public bicycle usage and providing reliable services that can improve ridership. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, significant barriers exist for the necessary large-scale implementation of NBS and market development is still in its infancy. This study presents findings from a systematic review of literature and a survey on private sector agents in the planning and implementation of NBS, with the aim to identify them. In this study, we propose a typology for organisations delivering NBS and a categorisation of their economic activities. The most common organisation type found is nature-based enterprise which offers products or services where nature is a core element and used sustainably and engages in economic activity. Moreover, eleven categories of economic activities were identified, ranging from ecosystem restoration, living green roofs, and eco-tourism to smart technologies and community engagement for NBS. Nature-based enterprises contribute to a diverse range of sustainable economic activities, that standard industry classification systems do not adequately account for. The recognition of the value created by these activities is essential for designing effective policy support measures, and for market development of the sector and its potential to facilitate the wider adoption of NBS. © 2021 by the authors.

Generally, higher volatility makes options more valuable, and vice versa. During periods of high volatility, financial markets are relatively more efficient. Volatility falls when markets rise and rise as markets fall. This paper focuses on examining the dynamics of European capital markets, S&P 500, GEPU, and VIX. Also, we observe the performance of S&P 500, Stoxx 600, and Stoxx Europe 600 Travel and Leisure price index. The analyzed period is 2003–2016. The results show that studied stock indices tend to move synchronously during the examined period. We register a high level of volatility for the period 2007–2011. The first major bottom of VIX is in December 2007. We can conclude that there is a strong correlation between VIX, GEPU, and S&P500 measuring “investor risk appetite”. GEPU fluctuates around consistently high levels since mid-2011 until the beginning of 2013. The dynamics of GEPU and VIX are not synchronized for the period 2013–2016.

In addition to the longer time spent in travel, for networks where fare is based on distance traveled, higher circuity also means higher fare for the same Euclidean distance. This makes circuity relevant from an equity perspective. Using a case study of the urban transit network of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, this study explores the role of transit circuity on the disparity in distance traveled by travelers' income profile and its implications on travel times and costs for networks with distance-based fares. The analysis is based on travel patterns from smart card data for bus, tram, and metro modes, combined with neighborhood level income data. Results reveal that in Amsterdam, the higher the share of high income people living in proximity to a transit stop, the lower the circuity of journeys from the stop, when controlled for the Euclidean distance covered and spatial auto-correlation. The uneven distribution of circuity exacerbates the disparity in distance traveled, and hence fare paid between the income groups. However, the travel time per Euclidean distance favors the low income group, possibly due to the circuitous routes serving these areas being compensated by higher travel speeds. This study highlights the role of transit network design in determining its equity outcomes and emphasizes the importance of considering equity during route and fare planning. The process followed can be adapted to examine equity for other urban networks. © 2021 The Authors","Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland; efficiency measurement; equity; income distribution; low income population; transportation economics; travel behavior; travel time; urban transport, Circuity; Equity; Fare policy; Low-income; Network efficiency; Transit networks",English,Article,259,4,Mobility and Transportation

36663088400,Electric Travelling Planner as a Support for Promoting Of Environmental Friendly Mobility - Remarks Based On International Research Project,2021,"Energy consumption is one of the main problems of the modern world in relation to industry, life and especially transport. In many countries, current rapid changes related to the development of electromobility are aimed at reducing emissions and introducing responsible management of energy consumption (according to among others EU White Papers guidelines). The expected increase in the number of electric vehicles on roads, the development of infrastructure, and organizational changes have created an information gap regarding travelling options. Therefore, lack of knowledge was identified. Travelers, as direct users of the transport system, often do not have enough knowledge about new technologies, including electric cars, the negative impact of transport on the environment (comparison of different modes of transport), about transport infrastructure (including the location of charging points), which results in fear about the small range of the electric car. Finally, there is lack of tools to support travel planning with the use of an electric car. Regarding to this, Electric Travelling Planner (ETPlanner) tool has been developed by the international research project of ‘Electric travelling - platform to support the implementation of electromobility in Smart Cities based on ICT applications’ under the ERA-NET CoFund Electric Mobility Europe Programme financed among others from the means of the National Centre for Research and Development. ETPlanner allows to find optimal route between the origin and destination places and also allows to compare travel by time, distance, cost and negative impact on the environment. In addition to the basic functionalities popular in other planners, ETPlanner encompasses transport chains using existing Park and Ride and Bike and Ride systems and car-sharing and bike-sharing systems. In the case of an electric passenger car, the range barrier is very important to break. The optimized route is set taking into account charging stations available in the city and the user can receive information about the need to recharge batteries during their travel. ETPlanner can be connected to Intelligent Transport Systems operating in the city and the system can set better routes that take into account congestion and availability of charging stations. Environmental benefits and incentives for users make electric cars more popular in the world. Full implementation of electromobility requires a multi-faceted approach and integration with existing transport systems. The transfer of information is as important as changes in transport systems. That is why the developed tool can be one of elements supporting promotion and faster implementation of electromobility in cities. © 2021, Avestia Publishing.

However, relations between the two countries in the Arctic took a special, even more developed turn, during the Obama administration; there was bilateral cooperation in the areas of science, defense, and intelligence, and also in the domain of environmental protection and the mapping of continental shelves. During the Trump presidency, areas of cooperation have instead been limited to trade, border security, and maritime affairs. Nevertheless their partnership stays strong and they maintain certain joint activities regarding the High North. There are some challenges to deal with in the Arctic. On the one hand, tourism in the area is on the rise; on the other hand, the Trump administration is inclined to open previously protected areas for the exploitation of resources. No one can avoid thinking, in this context, of potential dangers. In the case of oil spills or search and rescue scenarios, cooperation between Canada and the US is necessary and even these two states might turn out to be insufficient and also require the involvement of Russia, which both powers would rather like to avoid after recent tensions. Therefore, continuing bilateral cooperation and even trilateral dialogue is crucial. The USA and Canada are important partners in Arctic matters, especially in defence and security, and their cooperation endures in spite of their different perspectives on several issues. This cooperation is crucial for protecting North America from external threats. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2020.

A Geospatial Analysis of Wetland Transformations in the Coastal Resort Town of Digha, West Bengal, India",2021,"The growth of tourism often expedites the process of urbanization in terms of expanding built-up areas and other impervious surfaces at the cost of the original natural serenity. The coastal resort town of Digha, situated at the Medinipur coastal plain of West Bengal, India, had been developed after substantial land use conversions and loss of perennial interdunal wetlands. The effects of wetland transformations are more evident in terms of continuous ecosystem degeneration and reduction of subsistence-based livelihood provisions for the local populace. However, this trend of urban expansion was severely contested by the ‘smart city’ concept which the State Government had envisaged for the sustainable development of Digha Township in recent years. This new concept advocated for a balanced land use planning giving adequate attention to its green infrastructure and urban ecological standards towards developing the cities of the new century. An appropriate assessment of the present patterns of urbanization and consequent environmental transformations thus becomes the prerequisite of any such development endeavour. In this context, the present study aimed to quantify the cumulative stress of expanding buildups on the interdunal wetland ecosystems around the renowned coastal resort town of Digha of this region through a coupling of geospatial technologies with statistical analyses. For this purpose, Normalized Difference Built-up Index and Soil Moisture Index were derived from the multispectral Landsat images of the year 2000 and 2018, respectively, as indicative physical and bio-physical parameters. The linear maximum likelihood regression model was then applied on these derivatives to infer the spatio-temporal relationships between the expansion of buildups and changes in wetland characteristics of this area. Results indicated that the magnitude of wetland encroachment was more severe within the newly developed high-density built-up areas. Moreover, the interdunal wetlands were found to be shrinking more rapidly in 2018 compared to that of the 2000 scenario in direct correspondence with the enhanced growth of built-up zones. Remarkably, a few sites in the rural fringes were also experiencing aggravated loss of soil moisture contents chiefly due to the establishment of isolated resort compounds and gated housing complexes in spite of being quite far from the core urban zones. Incessantly changing tourist preferences towards secluded lifestyles and demand for serene landscapes as well as lacklustre implementation status of land development regulations were primarily attributed to this sporadic nature of land use conversions in this region. Based on the findings, a few realistically attainable management guidelines have been recommended towards developing a true ‘smart city’ in terms of both ecological composure and sustenance of tourism initiatives. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Built-up area; Interdunal wetland; Land use conversion; Remote sensing; Resort tourism; Smart city",English,Book chapter,425,3,Urban Sustainability

Passive measurement techniques, when humans are not involved are the cheapest way for collecting large amounts of long-Term data from multiple public transport lines. Useful data can be collected from various sources, such as from cameras, infrared sensors and Wi-Fi routers. We addressed the problems of estimating passenger counts in two different ways, and also to get travel statistics like the number of passengers getting on or off a vehicle at a bus stop; and even to compute an origin-destination matrix from Wi-Fi monitoring data. In this study, we focus on Wi-Fi data, which can be still useful for extracting relevant data after many years. Here we describe Wi-Fi data collection methods, and then prove the usefulness of applying simple artificial intelligence-based methods to extract information from the huge amount of Wi-Fi data. We will also show that 'lower-level re-estimation' can be useful for further optimization, which means that globally modelled data may have to be re-modelled on partially selected groups to get better results. Namely, after building linear models and estimating absolute and relative errors, we found that the relative error of the Wi-Fi-based estimation can be markedly reduced if data are processed and analysed in more detail. When a daily Wi-Fi analysis is split into between-stops parts, an additive linear correction can be computed and applied to these parts, and as a result, the relative error of estimates can be reduced. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

56786204200; 8271942000; 25925454000,An Approach to Intelligent Control Public Transportation System Using a Multi-agent System,2021,"Traffic congestion has increased globally during the last decade representing an undoubted menace to the quality of urban life. A significant contribution can be made by the public transport system in reducing the problem intensity if it provides high-quality service. However, public transportation systems are highly complex because of the modes involved, the multitude of origins and destinations, and the amount and variety of traffic. They have to cope with dynamic environments where many complex and random phenomena appear and disturb the traffic network. To ensure good service quality, a control system should be used in order to maintain the public transport scheduled timetable. The quality service should be measured in terms of public transport key performance indicators (KPIs) for the wider urban transport system and issues. In fact, in the absence of a set of widely accepted performance measures and transferable methodologies, it is very difficult for public transport to objectively assess the effects of specific regulation system and to make use of lessons learned from other public transport systems. Moreover, vehicle traffic control tasks are distributed geographically and functionally, and disturbances might influence on many itineraries and occur simultaneously. Unfortunately, most existing traffic control systems consider only a part of the performance criteria and propose a solution without man-aging its influence on neighboring areas of the network. This paper sets the context of performance measurement in the field of public traffic management and presents the regulation support system of public transportation (RSSPT). The aim of this regulation support system is (i) to detect the traffic perturbation by distinguishing a critical performance variation of the current traffic, (ii) and to find the regulation action by optimizing the performance of the quality service of the public transportation. We adopt a multi-agent approach to model the system, as their distributed nature, allows managing several disturbances concurrently. The validation of our model is based on the data of an entire journey of the New York City transport system in which two perturbation scenarios occur. This net-work has the nation’s largest bus fleet and more subway and commuter rail cars than all other U.S. transit systems combined. The obtained results show the efficiency of our system especially in case many performance indicators are needed to regulate a disturbance situation. It demonstrates the advantage as well of the multiagent approach and shows how the agents of different neighboring zones on which the disturbance has an impact, coordinate and adapt their plans and solve the issue. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Benchmarking; Bus transportation; Complex networks; Control systems; Fleet operations; Information systems; Information use; Intelligent agents; Man machine systems; Multi agent systems; Quality control; Urban transportation; Key performance indicators; Performance indicators; Performance measurements; Performance variations; Public transport systems; Public transportation; Public transportation systems; Urban transport systems; Traffic congestion, Key performance indicators; Multi-agent systems; Optimization; Public transportation; Regulation system",English,Conference paper,417,4,Mobility and Transportation

The ZWE will account for the City’s net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from the solid waste sector, assess and reevaluate the prioritization of the City’s zero waste strategies, and address related critical issues regarding recycling markets, changing waste regulations, domestic reuse potential, local infrastructure related to solid waste, and landfill capacity. This paper and presentation will discuss the approach used by the City of San José and its consultants to analyze the existing solid waste stream (one that is already ahead of the curve when it comes to material recovery and waste reduction) and identify a path towards a true zero-waste city. In order to quantify GHG emissions from the City’s baseline management waste scenario, material flow models were created for each of the waste and recovery streams. These models numerically represent the flow of material from collection to final destination, including every stop in between. When paired with the City’s existing visual material flow graphics and data from previous characterization studies, the flow models both paint a clear picture of the progress San José has made in regard to Zero Waste goals and identify areas to implement strategies to maintain forward momentum in the waste-reduction realm. Alternative management scenarios were analyzed and compared for their GHG reduction benefits in order for the City to meet both Zero Waste and GHG emission reduction goals.

The Blue Growth, a knowledge driven exploitation of the marine resources, is a target that EU and many other countries have set to improve the societal wellbeing. In particular the Mediterranean has still unexploited potentials to provide very specific ecosystem services and new technologies in order to contribute to economic growth. To this aim, the European Commission funded the Bluemed project (2016-2020), which involves nine different European countries (Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain) and their relevant stakeholders in the definition of shared strategies at national and international level; the Italian National Research Council (CNR) coordinates Bluemed. Given this framework, the present paper, starts from the main outcomes of Bluemed on research and innovation in the Mediterranean, through a detailed analysis of the most relevant activities and thematic objectives for some of the main marine and maritime socio-economic drivers (transport, tourism, energy have been chosen). Then, on that basis and with the support of a deep literature overview, it tries to understand the present status of some relevant sectors for their potential impact on technology and innovation on this maritime area, highlighting the main obstacles to the fulfilment of the planned priorities and proposing possible strategies to overcome them; all this starting from an Italian perspective. The emphasis is put just on the gaps and barriers to Blue Growth, and on the ways to overcome them, to help the identification of cross-cutting high-level priorities and actions for research and innovation, to be shared at national and Mediterranean level. The main contribution of the work presented here is the recognition that concrete steps towards a “Blue” economy can be achieved only by going beyond the identification of research and innovation challenges and priorities for specific sectors, since they necessarily reflect a partial, sectorial view, and that the main effort must be directed towards an integrated view of how different activities, often conflicting, might coexists. Another finding is the planning of roadmaps to follow so that new technologies/knowledge could overcome those conflicts. As a consequence, the aim and the output of the paper is not proposing a further detailed list of Research and Innovation priorities, but is instead trying to identify how the most relevant R&I challenges for Blue Growth already available can be more efficiently pursued following the roadmaps proposed in the paper.

Nevertheless, these potential measurements only illustrate the maximum possible accessibility a person can have, which may not accurately measure real-world transit accessibility in urban areas. This paper introduces a novel methodology to measure positive public transit accessibility based on multi-source big public transit data such as Smart Card Data (SCD) and Global Navigation Satellite System trajectory data, which embed rich travel information and real-world spatio-temporal constraints. First, we use multi-source transit data to reconstruct trip chains, which are used to extract popular destinations. A novel transit accessibility measure is defined to account for latent trip information such as mode/route preference, opportunity attraction, and travel impedance that are difficult to capture explicitly via traditional normative measures. Finally, we produce accessibility maps to visualize time-varying and heterogeneous accessibility patterns distributed over the study region. We performed an empirical evaluation on real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China, demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in mapping positive transit accessibility over large metropolitan areas. The results and findings of the empirical study demonstrate that the proposed positive accessibility measure can better capture travel behavior characteristics and constraints than traditional normative measures. The measurement method can be used as a practical high-resolution mapping tool for transit decision makers in evaluating public transit systems, supporting strategic transit planning, and improving daily transit management. © 2021 Wuhan University.

The seasonal nature of tourism produces an impact on the urban hierarchies, since it affects the labor, residential, and recreational markets. As a result, people move to and in the destination and it challenges the supply of sustainable modes of transport such as public transport. This research is set within the context of three demanding challenges that tourist destinations need to face-up: to increase environmental sustainability, to enhance destination competitiveness, and finally to assure quality and comfort of public transport services for the local resident population. Camp de Tarragona region, where Costa Daurada (one of the most important Spanish tourist brands) is located, is analyzed to illustrate how different data sources can aid to confront the aforementioned challenges. Given that seasonality is a dynamic phenomenon, suitable data should be flexible in terms of its time framework. To this end data from smart travel cards provided by the consortium that manages the public transport system in the region has been analyzed. Data unveiled the impact of seasonality on the evolution of demand throughout the year, the type of transport tickets used, or changes occurred in the geographical distribution of the mobility Alternative data sources such as surveys and passive mobile positioning data have also been examined, and their pros and cons have been addressed. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",", Big data; Costa Daurada; Public transport; Seasonality; Smart travel card data; Tourist destination",English,Book chapter,233,4,Mobility and Transportation

For example, the travel time of tourists coincides with the rush hour of urban residents' daily commuting. Limited urban traffic resources cannot meet the travel needs of tourists and urban residents at the same time, resulting in traffic congestion and low travel efficiency. Now, with the development of intelligent technology, tourists can obtain real-time information about transportation systems through various channels and adjust their travel behavior accordingly. This study shows tourists' travel behavior based on a survey conducted to the tourists in Yangzhou city. 1500-interview data are analyzed, and a Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) was employed to establish the probability prediction model of tourists' departure time choice. The results presented that sync traffic information and some other tourism-related factors determine the choice of tourists' departure time. These factors distinguish the travel behavior of tourists from the daily travel behavior of urban residents. This study can provide suggestions for the urban tourism management department to formulate more targeted and efficient policies while creating a more comfortable tourism environment for tourists.  © 2021 Shijun Yu et al.",", Real time systems; Tourism; Travel time; Departure time; Economic benefits; Multi-Sources; Traffic information; Traffic resources; Travel behaviour; Travel efficiency; Travel-time; Urban traffic; Urban traffic system; Traffic congestion",English,Article,192,4,Mobility and Transportation

This paper presents Snap4City as a big data smart city platform to support the city decision makers by means of SCCR dashboards and tools reporting in real time the status of several of a city’s aspects. The solution has been adopted in European cities such as Antwerp, Florence, Lonato del Garda, Pisa, Santiago, etc., and it is capable of covering extended geographical areas around the cities themselves: Belgium, Finland, Tuscany, Sardinia, etc. In this paper, a major use case is analyzed describing the workflow followed, the methodologies adopted and the SCCR as the starting point to reproduce the same results in other smart cities, industries, research centers, etc. A Living Lab working modality is promoted and organized to enhance the collaboration among municipalities and public administration, stakeholders, research centers and the citizens themselves. The Snap4City platform has been realized respecting the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and it is capable of processing every day a multitude of periodic and real-time data coming from different providers and data sources. It is therefore able to semantically aggregate the data, in compliance with the Km4City multi-ontology and manage data: (i) having different access policies; and (ii) coming from traditional sources such as Open Data Portals, Web services, APIs and IoT/IoE networks. The aggregated data are the starting point for the services offered not only to the citizens but also to the public administrations and public-security service managers, enabling them to view a set of city dashboards ad hoc composed on their needs, for example, enabling them to modify and monitor public transportation strategies, offering the public services actually needed by citizens and tourists, monitor the air quality and traffic status to establish, if impose or not, traffic restrictions, etc. All the data and the new knowledge produced by the data analytics of the Snap4City platform can also be accessed, observing the permissions on each kind of data, thanks to the presence of an APIs complex system. © 2021, The Author(s).","Advanced APIs; Big data architecture; Decision-support system; IoT; Smart City Control Room, Air quality; Data Analytics; Data privacy; Decision making; Public administration; Smart city; Sustainable development; Web services; Aggregated datum; European cities; Geographical area; Multi-ontologies; Public services; Public transportation; Research center; Traffic restrictions; Open Data",English,Conference paper,347,3,Urban Sustainability

While many smart tourism concepts focus solely on the development of technology, people, and institutional logic, the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EES) approach helps to strengthen smart destinations on their way to fostering the development of urban sustainability. As part of an evaluation of the EES, qualitative interviews (n = 14) with key informants demonstrate the importance of entrepreneurship for the development of smart destinations. To identify the relevant factors for this kind of smart city positioning, the following study aims to explore, test, and analyze smart city aspects among experts in terms of EES, residents, and tourists visiting Innsbruck. The present study uses both face-to-face interviews and surveys to explore initiatives and targets within the city's EES development as perceived by core stakeholders. It applies a questionnaire measuring local residents' and tourists' perceptions of important smart city attributes (n = 336). The data shows that residents believe Innsbruck has the potential to become a smart city. Furthermore, the data confirms that the EES approach benefits from the tourism industry in the region, with tourism found to improve the respective EES elements, consequently leading to enhanced entrepreneurial activity. © 2020 CAUTHE - COUNCIL FOR AUSTRALASIAN TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY EDUCATION",", Entrepreneurial activity; Local residents; Networks; Smart city attributes; Tourism destinations; Tourists",English,Article,223,3,Urban Sustainability

55440028800,Al-Jaya palace and the new shawbak town. A medieval frontier and the return of the urbanism in the Southern Transjordan,2020,"The recent discovery – made during the 2018 campaign of the ‘Medieval Petra’ Mission of the University of Florence – of the residential al-Jaya Palace at the bottom of the hill of Shawbak’s ‘incastellato’ site is of particular relevance both for medieval and Islamic heritage in Jordan (no architecture of a comparable quality from the Ayyubid-Mamluk period has ever been found in the country) and mostly for the archaeological confirmation that underneath al-Jaya, lays the ancient medieval capital city of southern Jordan, founded by Saladin, on the same site of the castle-capital of the previous Crusader Lordship of Transjordan. This result represents a triple confirmation for the scientific program of the Mission: the productivity of the ‘Light Archaeology’ methodology that characterizes our approach; the real existence of the city whose foundation we had deemed to be able to propose (owing solely to the ‘light’ readings on the walls of the ‘castle’); and the excellence of the formal level of the building – perfectly matching the quality of the political and productive structures documented earlier in the castle – that speaks of a cultured and refined city and of an extraordinary strategic project that can be attributed to Saladin’s political intelligence. A project that gave back a new centrality to the entire southern Transjordan and started a settlement and political tradition that is the basis of modern Jordan itself (it is not accidental that the first capital of the state was Ma’an). Once the urban structure that has now appeared is understood, future research will be able to direct the excavations so as to address another great historical question which 2018 investigations have highlighted: we know the birth and begin to read the life of this extraordinary town, but when, how and why did it perish so much so that it was forgotten by history (and to be rediscovered by archaeology)? Perhaps for the first time, we will have an opportunity to study archaeologically an aspect of the historical crisis that, probably during the 15th century, engulfed the Arab-Islamic world, opening the way for the Ottoman conquest. It is an intriguing perspective to be addressed in tandem with a renewed public archaeology program: conservative restoration, social valorization, broad communication directed both to the local communities and to the international public with the implementation of the master plan 2010-14, and, finally, tourist routes connecting Shawbak with the Petra area. © 2020 Ksiegarnia Akademicka.

Successful monitoring and management of plant resources worldwide needs the involvement of civil society to support natural reserve managers. Because it is difficult to correctly and quickly identify plant species for non-specialists, the development of recent techniques based on automatic visual identification should facilitate and increase public engagement in citizen science initiatives. 2. Automatic identification platforms are new to most citizen scientists and land managers. Pl@ntNet is such a platform, available since 2013 on web and mobile environments, and now included in several workflows such as invasive alien species management, endemic species monitoring, educational activities and eco-tourism practices. The successful development of such platforms needs to identify their strengths and weaknesses in order to improve and facilitate their use in all aspects of ecosystem management. 3. Here we present two Pl@ntNet citizen science initiatives used by conservation practitioners in Europe (France) and Africa (Kenya). We discuss various perspectives, including benefits and limitations. Based on the experiences of field managers, we formulate several recommendations for future initiatives.

For that purpose, Twitter data from the Madrid Metro account is collected over a two-month period. Topics and sentiments are identified from text mining and machine learning algorithms, and mapped to explore spatial and temporal patterns. Lastly, a Geographically Weighted Regression model is used to explore the causality of the spatial distribution of complaining users, by using official data sources as exploratory variables.

However, a key part of the National Energy and Climate Plan is to gradually phase out the use of lignite, which includes the decommissioning of all existing lignite units by 2023, except the Ptolemaida V unit, which will be closed by 2028. This plan makes Greece a frontrunner among countries who intensively use lignite in energy production. In this context, this paper investigates the environmental, economic, and social state of Megalopolis and the related perspectives with regard to the energy transition, through the elaboration of a SWOT analysis, highlighting the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the municipality of Megalopolis and the regional unit of Arcadia. The analysis is based on four main pillars, namely “clean energy”, “smart agricultural production”, “sustainable tourism”, and “other (e.g., industry, technology, and education)”. The integration of the “Energy Efficiency First” principle, the mitigation of household energy poverty (especially in a region with district heating installations), and collectively driven energy actions for engaging and empowering younger generations (e.g., in the form of next‐generation energy communities) are among the solutions that are expected to have a significant contribution towards Megalopolis’ just energy transition. © 2020 by the authors.

57221683196; 57205207936,Taxing the Smart Retail: Value Added Tax Policy Analysis on Digital Transactions in Indonesia,2020,"Digital transactions rapidly dominate the trading system in the current era by providing quick and real-time fulfillment of life needs, including logistical needs, availability of public services, entertainment, and others. Moreover, the high number of digital transactions show prospects of potential tax extensification, mainly through the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT). Besides paying attention to the concept of consumption-based taxation in its collection, taxes on digital transactions can also increase state revenue as a source of income. The government needs to implement a policy strategy to optimize digital transactions' taxation through the VAT policy on Trade Through Electronic System. In a trade transaction, the consumer is the party that uses the goods and/or services obtained. Consumption of goods and/or services is subject to VAT. Regardless of the products' origin, VAT will be imposed because the goods and/or services are consumed within the customs area, including those imported from outside the customs area. This research discusses taxing digital transactions, a policy strategy for tax authorities through VAT of Trade Through Electronic System. This study aims to analyze the government's implementation strategy and compare VAT policy, especially on foreign e-commerce transactions of Digital Goods and Services in ASEAN countries. The qualitative approach is used as a research method, using an in-depth interview and literature study as data collection techniques. According to the equality principle, the policy formulation is based on the government's attempt to collect VAT on goods and/or services from overseas as one of the principles of tax collection and neutrality as VAT's main characteristics. Taxing digital transactions is also following the destination principle and is based on the principle of revenue productivity in taxation. Furthermore, the government's implementation strategy is to conduct dissemination and organize a decent implementation framework, both from the technology and business point of view. © 2020 IEEE.","Commerce; Public policy; E-commerce transactions; Electronic systems; Implementation strategies; In-depth interviews; Literature studies; Policy formulation; Qualitative approach; research methods; Taxation, electronic commerce; import; Smart retail; Trade through Electronic Systems; Value Added Tax policy",English,Conference paper,302,4,Mobility and Transportation

In general, it can be defined as the integration of IoT and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) into city management, with the aim of addressing the exponential growth of urbanization and population, thus significantly increasing people’s quality of life. The smart city paradigm is also strictly connected to sustainability aspects, taking into account, for example, the reduction of environmental impact of urban activities, the optimized management of energy resources, and the design of innovative services and solution for citizens. Abiding by this new paradigm, several cities started a process of strong innovation in different fields (such as mobility and transportation, industry, health, tourism, and education), thanks to significant investments provided by stakeholders and the European Commission (EC). In this paper, we analyze key aspects of an IoT infrastructure for smart cities, outlining the innovations implemented in the city of Parma (Emilia Romagna region, Italy) as a successful example. Special attention is dedicated to the theme of smart urban mobility. © 2020 by the authors.

55945649800; 57360860200; 6602519121,Adjusting freight train paths to infrastructure possessions,2020,"This paper tackles railway timetabling with infrastructure work possessions. It introduces the integrated Passenger and Freight Train Timetable Adjustment Problem (PF-TTAP) which handles both passenger as well as freight trains. To deal with possessions, passenger trains are typically retimed, reordered or partially cancelled, while for freight trains it is important to reach their destination, possibly using an alternative path. Alternative paths for freight trains are generated using the k-shortest path algorithm. To solve the PFTTAP, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem is developed to simultaneously retime, reroute and cancel trains in the network. The model aims at minimizing deviations from the original timetable and in particular selecting alternative freight paths with the least turning activities and noncommercial stops. The model was tested on the Dutch national railway network. The PF-TTAP model successfully created an alternative hour pattern satisfying all the railway stakeholders. © 2020 IEEE.","Freight transportation; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Passenger cars; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Scheduling; Alternative path; Freight trains; K-shortest path algorithms; Mixed-integer linear programming; Passenger train; Railway network; Railway timetabling; Freight cars, disruption; freight; maintenance; passenger; possessions; Railway; resilience; timetable adjustment",English,Conference paper,146,4,Mobility and Transportation

After the main peak of the crisis, restrictions were gradually removed, returning to a new normal situation. This process has impacted urban mobility. The limited information on the new normal situation shows changes that can be permanent or reversible. The impact on the diverse urban transport modes varies. This study analyzes the changes in transit ridership by line, the use of stops, the main origin-destination flows, changes in transit supply, operation time, and reliability of the city bus network of A Coruna. It is based on data from automatic vehicle location, bus stop boarding, and smart card use. Data from the first half of 2020 were compared to similar data in 2017-2019, defining suitable baselines for each analysis to avoid seasonal and day of week effects. The impact on transit ridership during the lockdown process was more significant than that on general traffic. In the new normal situation, the general traffic and the shared bike system recovered a higher percentage of their previous use than the bus system. These impacts are not uniform across the bus network. © 2020 by the authors.","COVID-19; Sustainable modes; Transit demand; Transit supply; Urban mobility, Galicia [Spain]; La Coruna [Galicia]; Spain; bus transport; mobility; road traffic; social impact; urban transport; viral disease",English,Article,198,4,Mobility and Transportation

However, they can only account for trips paid by smartcard. Trips paid by other means, as well as non-paid trips, must be incorporated using additional information. This paper discusses the biases that are introduced due to fare evasion and presents a sequential method to estimate correction factors due to partial evasion in some trip stages, as well as total fare evasion in all trip stages, using external information regarding trips not registered in the smartcard database. We apply this method to the case of Santiago, Chile, where partial evasion (during a bus trip stage prior to a Metro trip stage) and total evasion (during all bus-only trip stages) are relevant fare evasion situations. Information from the Santiago Metro Origin-Destination survey and from external fare evasion measurements is used. The results indicate a 5% partial evasion rate for bus trip stages prior to Metro trip stages, and a 37% total fare evasion rate for bus-only trips.

This study aims to determine the points of interest of urban residents by analyzing big data from search engines to reveal the physical characteristics of POIs. To achieve this, POI data were collected in three city centers in Seoul using a South Korean dominant portal site that includes a search engine. The most popular POIs were determined by using GIS search engine analysis frequency, and correlation and regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relation between POIs and urban elements. The results revealed different POI trends in each city center. While POIs were concentrated in old, narrow streets with small attractions and mixed-use construction near Seoul City Wall (historic downtown district), they also formed around notable architectural landmarks in the newly developed Yeouido and Yeongdeungpo areas. This study found that tourism attraction took different forms in old and new areas, demonstrating that citizens are interested in both historic downtown areas and new areas, as traditional urban theorists suggest. Thus, urban planners and tourism policy makers should consider specific spatial contexts with search engines. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Point of interest; POIs; Search engine; Seoul; Smart tourism, Seoul; architectural design; GIS; historic building; historical perspective; tourism development; urban planning; urban transport; World Wide Web",English,Article,197,3,Urban Sustainability
57196901692; 57219939329; 35293201200,Sride: An online system for multi-hop ridesharing,2020,"In the context of smart cities, ridesharing in urban areas is gaining researchers’ interest and is considered to be a sustainable transportation solution. In this paper, we present SRide (Shared Ride), a multi-hop ridesharing system as a mode of sustainable transportation. Multi-hop ridesharing is a type of ridesharing in which a rider travels in multiple hops to reach a destination, transferring from one driver to another between hops. The key problem in multi-hop ridesharing is to find an optimal itinerary or route plan for a rider from an origin to a destination in a dynamic, online setting. SRide adopts a novel approach to finding itineraries for riders suited to the online nature of the problem. The system represents ride offers as a time-dependent directed graph and finds itineraries dynamically by updating the graph incrementally and decrementally as ride offers are updated in the system. The system’s distinguishing feature is its incremental and decremental operation, which is enabled by employing dynamic single-source shortest-path algorithms. We conducted two extensive simulation studies to evaluate its performance. Metrics, including the matching rate, savings in total system-wide vehicle-miles, and total system-wide driving times were measured. In the first study, SRide’s dynamic update algorithms were compared with their non-dynamic versions. Results show that SRide’s algorithms run up to thirteen times faster than their non-dynamic versions. In the second study, we used data from the travel demand model for metropolitan Atlanta in the US state of Georgia, to assess the benefits of multi-hop ridesharing. Results show that matching rates increase up to 68%, saving in total system-wide vehicle-miles of up to 12%, and reduction in the total system-wide driving time of up to 12.86% is achieved. © 2020 by the authors.

7003304761; 57199495745,Route guidance ranking procedures with human perception consideration for personalized public transport service,2020,"The use of smartphone applications (apps) to acquire real time and readily available journey planning information is becoming instinctive behavior by public transport (PT) users. Through the apps, a passenger not only seeks a path from origin to destination, but a satisfactory path that caters to the passenger's preferences at the desired time of travel. Essentially, apps attempt to provide a means of personalized PT service. As the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic take form and infiltrate human and environmental interactions, passenger preference personalization will likely include avoiding risks of infection or contagious contact. The personal preferences are enabled by multiple attributes associated with alternative PT routes. For instance, preferences can be connected to attributes of time, cost, and convenience. This work establishes a personalized PT service, as an adjustment to current design frameworks, by integrating user app experience with operators’ data sources and operations modeling. The work proceeds to focus on its key component: the personalized route guidance methodology. In addition to using the existing shortest path or k-weighted shortest path method, this study develops a novel, lexicographical shortest path method, considering a just noticeable difference (JND). The method adopts lexicographical ordering to capture passenger preferences for different PT attributes following Ernst Weber's law of human perception threshold. However, a direct application of Weber's law violates the axiom of transitivity required for an implementable algorithm, and thus, a revised method is developed with proven algorithms for ranking different paths. The differences between the three route-guidance methods and the effects of the JND perception threshold on the order of the alternative PT routes are demonstrated with an example. The developments were examined in a case study by simulation on the Copenhagen PT network. The results show that using the JND method reduces the value/cost of the most important attributes. Identical robust results are attained when JND parameters are not specified and default values are used. The latter may apply for the future with a mixture of specified and default preference input values. Finally, the computation time indicates a favorable potential for real-life applications. It is believed that the consideration of human threshold perception will encourage decision makers to establish new criteria to comply with this. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decision making; Graph theory; Environmental interactions; Just-noticeable difference; Perception thresholds; Planning information; Public transport service; Real-life applications; Shortest path method; Smart-phone applications; decision making; perception; public transport; ranking; transportation system; travel behavior; User experience, Personalization; Public transport planning; Route guidance",English,Article,369,4,Mobility and Transportation

Smart tourism destinations are territories based on information and communication technologies (ICT), which improve travelers’ tourist experiences as well as affect the quality of life of residents. To know the context of the relationships between tourism and quality of life, main studies and theories regarding these two phenomena are analyzed. Likewise, the relationship between smart places and quality of life is also studied. Therefore, a theoretical model on residents’ quality of life in smart tourism destinations is proposed based on a systematized analysis of the literature. From the theoretical model, it is perceived that residents’ overall life satisfaction results from the relationship between perceived tourism impacts and satisfaction with specific life factors, and they are measured by qualitative indicators. Also, it is identified that the quality of life of residents is clearly influenced by the impacts of tourism and ICTs. In addition, it is understood that the residents’ overall life satisfaction corroborates for the further development of the smart tourism destination. Finally, we understand that the knowledge of residents’ perception and satisfaction of their quality of life contribute to formulation and implementation of urban and tourism development policies in smart tourism destinations. © 2020 by the authors.

However, most of the previous studies have separately examined the travel patterns of docked and dockless bike-sharing schemes, whereas the difference in travel patterns and the determinants of user demand for both systems have not been fully understood. To fill this gap, this study firstly compares the travel characteristics, including travel distance, travel time, usage frequency and spatio-temporal travel patterns by exploring the smart card data from a docked bike-sharing scheme and trip origin–destination (OD) data from a dockless bike-sharing scheme in the city of Nanjing, China over the same spatio-temporal dimension. Next, this study examines the influence of the bike-sharing fleets, socio-demographic factors and land use factors on user demand of both bike-sharing systems using multi-sourced data (e.g., trip OD information, smart card, survey, land use information, and housing prices data). To this end, geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models are built to examine the determinants of user demand over space and time. Comparative analysis shows that dockless bike-sharing systems have a shorter average travel distance and travel time, but a higher use frequency and hourly usage volume compared to docked bike-sharing systems. Trips of docked and dockless bike-sharing on workdays are more frequent than those on weekends, especially during the morning and evening rush hours. Significant differences in the spatial distribution between docked and dockless bike-sharing systems are observed in different city areas. The results of the GTWR models reveal that hourly docked bike-sharing trips and dockless bike-share trips influence each other throughout the week. The density of Entertainment points of interest (POIs) is positively correlated with the usage of dockless bike-sharing, but negatively correlated with docked bike-sharing usage. On the contrary, the proportion of the elderly has a positive association with the usage of docked bike-sharing, but a negative association with the usage of dockless bike-sharing. Finally, policy implications and suggestions are proposed to improve the performance of docked and dockless bike-sharing systems, such as increasing the flexibility of docked bike-sharing, designing and promoting mobile applications (APP) for docked bike-sharing, improving the quality of dockless shared bikes, and implementing dynamic time-based pricing strategies for dockless bike-sharing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Bicycles; Costs; Economics; Housing; Land use; Public policy; Smart cards; Travel time; Comparative analysis; Mobile applications; Policy implications; Public transport systems; Socio-demographic factors; Spatio-temporal dimensions; Sustainable transportation; Weighted regression; accessibility; comparative study; cycle transport; performance assessment; public transport; travel behavior; travel demand; Time sharing systems, Docked bike-sharing; Dockless bike-sharing; Geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model; Land use; Spatiotemporal variation; Travel behavior",English,Article,388,4,Mobility and Transportation

An intelligent charging guidance strategy and two algorithms were proposed to alleviate this problem. First, based on the next destination of EV users' trip, the strategy established a dynamic-area model to match charging stations with users' travel demand intelligently. In the dynamic area, the Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the charging station with the shortest trip. Then, the area extension algorithm and the charging station attribution algorithm were developed to improve the robustness of the dynamic area. The two algorithms can automatically adjust the area size according to the number of charging stations in the dynamic area to reduce the number of nodes traversed by the Dijkstra algorithm. Finally, simulation examples were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms. The results showed that the proposed intelligent charging guidance strategy can meet the travel demand of users. It is a promising technique in smart cities to find better travel trips with less travel distance and less computed time. © 2020 by the authors.","Dijkstra algorithm; Dynamic area; Electric vehicle; Intelligent charging guidance, algorithm; numerical model; simulation; travel demand",English,Article,194,4,Mobility and Transportation

We propose a novel integer linear programming model to maximize the number of disrupted passengers arriving at their pre-planned destinations, and to minimize the total delay of all train services and the number of cancelled train services. The mathematical formulation deals with the reassignment of disrupted passengers to non-cancelled train services by planning extra stops and the reassignment of rolling stocks to train services with consideration of the maintenance distance, limited seat capacity and required turnaround time. Other constraints focus on the limited track capacity, extra running time of deceleration and acceleration due to extra stops, and mapping the timetable rescheduling, the assignment of rolling stock and passengers.

In this paper, we develop two mathematical models in which we explore the possible benefits from two different skipping-stop strategies.

In the second model, some stations are also skipped by every second train, but without necessarily guaranteeing that every origin-destination pair is feasible without transfer.

In this paper, we propose the implementation of autonomous driving technology to address some of the current challenges of bicycle-sharing systems. We also propose a solution to provide bicycles of the necessary lateral stability to drive autonomously. Under this view, a fleet of autonomous shared bicycles would work as a mobility-on-demand system: when a user requested a ride, the nearest available bike would drive autonomously to wherever they are. Then, the user would ride it like a regular bike, and upon arrival to the destination, the bike would leave autonomously again for the next user. Such a system would eliminate the need for rebalancing and docking stations, and the needed fleet size would be smaller than in current station-based and dockless systems. In addition, it would solve the difficulty of finding available bicycles or docks and eliminate walking distance, improving the user experience and incentivizing its use. © 2020 IEEE.",", Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Sporting goods; Urban growth; User experience; Autonomous driving; Bicycle sharing; Docking station; Lateral stability; Mobility solutions; New approaches; On-demand systems; Rebalancing; Bicycles",English,Conference paper,181,4,Mobility and Transportation

Public transport systems with large fleets cannot be guaranteed to perform efficiently, unless it is well connected and accessible to maximum possible population.

Similarly, connectivity and accessibility index are calculated and enhanced based on distribution of public transport trips in zones and compared with each other to determine the critical nodes.

This route, referred to as last-mile delivery, generally uses smaller goods vehicles, to deliver low-volumes to multiple destinations. To optimise this process, route planning optimisation software is used, to maximise the number of deliveries a driver can complete in a day. To further optimise this process, companies are starting to test autonomous goods vehicles (AGVs). This paper presents an evaluation of the impact and barriers of AGVs for last-mile delivery in the UK, by conducting a study of people in the logistics industry and experts in autonomous technology. Qualitative analysis is used to identify positive and negative impacts of the introduction of driverless AGVs, and barriers, in terms of government policy and technical restrictions, which could slow down wide-scale adoption. From the results, we find logistics companies are being pressured to reduce lead-times and offer more predictable delivery-times. This is increasing pressure on the workforce, which already has high-turnover and difficulties in recruitment. Therefore, AGVs are considered a solution to a present problem, which is preventing logistics companies growing and achieving delivery targets, driven by public demand. © 2020 IEEE.",", Automobile testing; Autonomous vehicles; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Autonomous technology; Distribution centres; Logistics company; Logistics industry; Multiple destinations; Optimisation software; Qualitative analysis; Transport logistics; Automatic guided vehicles",English,Conference paper,200,4,Mobility and Transportation

57189072289,"Resilience as a city brand: The cases of the comuna 13 and moravia in Medellin, Colombia",2020,"In Medellin, during this last decade, the municipality and the private sector have been very active in the reconstruction of the city’s war-torn image. With the acknowledged objective of attracting foreign investments and tourists, the second city of Colombia has been consecutively branded as “innovative”, “smart”, “sustainable” and lately as a “resilient city”. Since 2016 and the integration of the city as one of the first members of the “100 Resilient Cities” network pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, Medellin’s authorities have emphasised “urban resilience” as a core value of the city and its residents. Until now, few studies have put into perspective the notion of “branding” with that of “resilience”. By looking closely at discourses on the promotion of the city, as well as its burgeoning tourism sector, this article aims to fill this gap by providing a thorough analysis of the way urban resilience is used as a city-brand in a city still struggling to overcome high levels of violence. This study aims to show that antagonists’ visions of resilience are at stake when comparing the branding discourses of public authorities and the representations of self-settled communities who are at the centre of these narratives. While branding discourses praise the resilience of Medellin communities, many in these same communities tend to reject this vision of resilience as self-reliance (adaptation) and instead call for structural changes (transformation). © 2020 by the author.

In practice, such promises can turn out to be either very limited in what is actually possible or quickly trigger dystopian scenarios of tracking and monitoring. Today, many cities around the world already measure forms of urban bustle, i.e. how busy it is during specific periods of time. They do this for all kinds of purposes like optimising mobility flows, attracting tourism, monitoring safety during events or stimulating the local economy, and they employ divergent technologies: from analogue counting, over surveys, to more advanced near real-time tracking using mobile operator data. This fragmentation of approaches to measuring urban bustle creates some challenges for cities related to privacy, vendor lock-in, comparability of data, data quality and accuracy, historical and predictive analysis of data and so on. To tackle these challenges and formulate a standardised approach to measuring urban bustle, the thirteen largest cities in Flanders (Belgium), together with local technology vendors, co-created a ""definition manual""; a document outlining indicators and relevant technologies for measuring urban bustle, as well as shared profile descriptions of residents and visitors of the city. This paper outlines the process and presents the results, an agreed-upon framework of standard profiles and indicators, which are useful to academics, public servants and technology companies involved in this topic. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

56800971700; 26429665700; 55720043900,Modelling socioeconomic attributes of public transit passengers,2020,"The lack of personal and economic attributes in emerging public transit big data (such as smart card data) is a general issue that needs to be addressed. Passengers in the public transit network are from different socioeconomic classes, and their trip attributes usually depend on their personal and economic attributes. For instance, age as a demographic attribute plays an important role in trip attributes; adolescent passengers travel to school, young professionals travel to work, and old passengers travel to medical facilities more often. Relations between the socioeconomic and trip attributes of the passengers can be examined by developing a Bayesian network that represents the relations between the attributes by directed acyclic graphs, and calculating the joint and conditional probability values in the graph. This study infers the socioeconomic attributes of the public transit passengers from the trip attributes through developing a Bayesian network. Considered socioeconomic attributes are age, gender, and income; considered trip attributes are start time and duration of the trip, stay duration, and available origin and destination land use types. First, potential structures of the Bayesian network are examined by comparing network scores and arc strength test. After learning the network’s parameters, the reasoning is done through both prediction and diagnosis in the network. Also, the most likely combinations of the socioeconomic and trip attributes are discovered. The case study for developing the Bayesian network is a Household Travel Survey dataset from Queensland, Australia, that contains both socioeconomic and trip attributes. Results clearly show how the socioeconomic attributes can be inferred from the trip attributes. Discovered probability distributions can be used to enrich the smart card datasets with the socioeconomic attributes. Moreover, the Bayesian classifier is applied to the dataset to validate the capability of the model in predicting the socioeconomic attributes. In the end, the developed network is implemented on a set of smart card records to discuss the potential applications. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Australia; Queensland; Bayesian analysis; data mining; household survey; modeling; probability; public transport; socioeconomic status; spatial analysis; travel behavior, Data mining; Decision graphs; Probabilistic models; Smart card data; Spatial analyses; Travel surveys",English,Article,323,4,Mobility and Transportation

During the last two decades, a growing body of literature has used this sort of data source to study the behaviour of public transport users in cities and regions around the world. However, its use has been scarce in contexts where public transport demand is highly influenced by the activities of the tourist sector. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether these data can be leveraged to optimize the supply of public transport. In this article, data drawn from the Camp de Tarragona automated fare collection system extracted during 2018 are used to study tourists' use of public transport in Costa Daurada (Catalonia, Spain). This is a popular coastal destination with a high concentration of visitors during the summer period. The analysis focuses on the use of the T-10, a multipersonal transport fare with no time limitations on its use which makes it appealing for tourists. Model-based clustering has been applied to identify different clusters of passengers according to their activity and spatial profiles. Differences between profiles are significant and, as a result, this study allowed the validation of a method that could be replicated in other contexts, as it provides highly useful information for public transport policy and mobility management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Catalonia; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]; information; mobility; public transport; tourist destination; transportation policy, Model-based clustering analysis; Public transport; Smart card data; Tourism destination; Tourist profiles; Travel behaviour",English,Article,226,4,Mobility and Transportation

To address this problem, this paper proposes a public transport passenger assignment method for estimating the time-dependent train occupancy comprising of a three-step modelling approach. Firstly, we make use of train station tap-on and tap-off information collected by Automated Fare Collection systems to estimate the initial timedependent Origin-Destination matrix (OD) of the train network. Secondly, we take advantage of real-time train scheduling data to calibrate the initial OD matrix according to travel time, transfer time and waiting times across train lines. Thirdly, the calibrated OD matrix together with train scheduling data are used to generate entire passenger travel trajectories from origins to destinations including all path segments, by following a probabilistic hybrid Markov-driven approach. Lastly, after knowing all passenger trajectories, we further estimate the passenger occupancy for every train in the entire network in a given short time window. The results are applied over the real Sydney train network in Australia, and showcase that the proposed method can accurately quantify time-dependent passenger flows at a station platform level of granularity. © 2020 IEEE.","Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Scheduling; Traffic control; Travel time; Automated fare collection; Critical problems; Origin-destination matrix; Passenger assignments; Public transport management; Service disruptions; Short time windows; Station platforms; Matrix algebra, OD estimation; public transport; train assignment",English,Conference paper,191,4,Mobility and Transportation

With the increasing population, the obvious thing, the waste generated per day continues to increase. India generates around 65 million tonnes of waste every year and out of which most of the part is not collected, remains untreated at landfills or open areas. This is ruining the beauty of India. And this is already impacting largely on environment, climate, soil, water bodies, national health, and tourism. That also means the waste in India is heading to largely affect the national economy and the global environment.

Drawing on the smart-city concept and considering the different historical developments of Alpine resorts, the Smart Altitude Decision-Making Toolkit was developed using a combination of an energy audit tool, a WebGIS, and collaborative and innovative living labs installed in Les Orres (France), Madonna di Campiglio (Italy), Krvavec (Slovenia), and Verbier (Switzerland). This step-by-step Decision-Making Toolkit enables ski resorts to get feedback on their energy demand, an overview of the locally available sources of renewable energy, and insights regarding their potential for improving their energy efficiency by low-carbon interventions. The Decision-Making Toolkit is suitable for knowledge transfer between stakeholders within living labs and moreover provides the flexibility for tailor-made low-carbon strategies adapting to the unique assets and situatedness of ski resorts. © 2020 by the authors.","Alps; France; Italy; Krvavec Mountain; Slovenia; Switzerland; Valais; Verbier; decision making; demand-side management; emission inventory; energy efficiency; GIS; greenhouse gas; historical record; innovation; interdisciplinary approach; knowledge; tourism development, Living lab; Low-carbon economy; Mountain tourism; Renewable energy; Resort towns; Transformation knowledge",English,Article,167,11,Rural Resource Management

The carbon Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is an incentive mechanism for citizens to value their energy conservation and carbon reduction. Individual travel needs to rely on various means of transportation, resulting in energy consumption. Carbon tax or subsidy can only be carried out after carbon GSP accurately measures individual carbon emissions. The big data acquired from the smart cards of passengers’ travels provide the possibility for carbon emission accounting of individual travel. This research proposes a carbon emission measurement of individual travel. Through establishing the network model of the Nanjing metro with a complex method, the shortest path of the passengers’ travels is obtained. Combined with the origination–destination (OD) records of the smart cards, the total distance of the passengers’ travels is obtained. By selecting the operation table to estimate the carbon emissions generated by the daily operation of the subway system, the carbon emissions per kilometer or per time of passenger travel are finally obtained. With the accurate tracking of carbon emissions for individual travel, the government may establish a comprehensive monitoring system so as to establish a carbon tax and carbon supplement mechanism for citizens. © MDPI AG.

This has led to the encouragement of smart village development through several forms of assistance, including Information Technology (IT) services from the government. Koto Gadang, one of the many Minangkabau customary villages in West Sumatra, has been used as a model for the development of an IT service that can support tourism known as a Web- and mobile-based geographic information system (GIS) for buildings (GB) in order to map and visualize buildings and their inhabitants. This paper reports the development of the GB. This study takes the form of a literature review, a survey, data collection, and software development. The results of the literature review and survey were used as the basis for software development. Aerial photographs of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), mosques, offices, schools, and health service centers, as well as residential buildings, were taken using a drone, while attribute data were collected directly by visiting the buildings. The users of the GB were divided into two groups: visitors and village officers. Moreover, there confidentiality was maintained for all the data provided, so the visitors were only allowed to search for buildings (MSMEs, offices, mosques, schools, and health centers) based on certain criteria, view locations, found information, and survey routes, while village officers were allowed to collect data on residents, buildings, and houses, and also search people’s homes. Furthermore, in situations where a visitor needs to find a resident’s house, the village officers are required to provide this assistance. These provisions were applied in the GB and implemented using the PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, PHP, CSS Bootstrap, jQuery, and Basic4Android, created according to the needs of the Koto Gadang smart customary village. The GB allows the village officers to better understand and monitor all the buildings, houses, and residents in the village and could also encourage many travelers to visit and see historic buildings and shop for embroidery and silver crafts. © 2020 by the authors.

Ports became a complex of functions and interactions with the city sharing its commercial, recreational, tourist, cultural, urban spaces and places for leisure. In addition to goods heavy traffic, the new port configuration also attracts important flows of people linked to the cruise sector, passenger traffic and tourism. This mix of activities, while inducing a great potential for transformation and strong changes on the urban economy, generates several externalities on the urban mobility system, such as congestion, accessibility, security and safety issues. The objective of this paper is to propose a framework for actions and measures to foster sustainability in ports. International best practices for passenger and freight port transport have been analysed with a focus on advantages and disadvantages of already implemented procedures, both in the short and in the long term. Most performing measures have been included in the framework, which classify them according to the three pillars of sustainability and the Avoid-Shift-Improve approach. The paper clearly defines the key elements needed to be taken into account when demonstrating efficiency of port systems.

It is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of the public transit operation in response to the individual traveller's demands for transit. This study aims to analyse the demand for transit with overlapping origin-destination (OD) pairs to enhance the efficiency of transit operations. To achieve this, disaggregated-level travel demand data, i.e. individual traveller's data are collected from an automatic fare collection system called smart card. The Kneedle algorithm is used to calculate the knee point of travel demand. The overlapping OD pairs, which are higher than the knee point value, are calculated and displayed in a map format. On the basis of the overlapping OD pairs, the demand-based overlap index for each bus route is defined to evaluate the efficiency of bus operations. The proposed method is applied to six districts with higher transit demands than other districts in Seoul. On the basis of the results, discussion on the action plans to enhance the efficiency of bus operations are presented.

57213619625; 6603533563,"How comparable are origin-destination matrices estimated from automatic fare collection, origin-destination surveys and household travel survey? An empirical investigation in Lyon",2020,"Origin–destination (OD) matrices are one of the key elements in travel behaviour analysis. For decades, transportation researchers have mostly used data obtained by active solicitation such as surveys to construct these matrices but new data sources like automatic fare collection (AFC) are now available and can be used to measure OD flows. As a result, a more heterogeneous corpus of data sources is now available to estimate travel demand. However, little research examines how comparable the estimated demands may be. In this paper, three data sources namely a household travel survey, a large scale origin–destination survey and entry only automated fare collection are processed to derive typical weekday public transit OD trip matrices. Various elements of the resulting matrices are then compared. While all the matrices share some common characteristics, there are also substantial differences that must be addressed. AFC data is not error-free and needs to be supplemented with data from other sources to construct a representative OD trip matrix. This is because not all destinations can be inferred, the smart card penetration rate is far less than 100% and fare evasion cannot be ignored. Our empirical results suggest that scaling an AFC matrix with automated passenger counts may be a viable solution. The results also indicate that the household travel survey significantly underestimates the volume of public transit trips compared to the other sources. The findings of this research contribute to a better understanding of the available data sources for public transit demand estimation. They can help practitioners to improve the quality and accuracy of OD matrices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; France; Grand Lyon; Lyons; Motor transportation; Smart cards; Surveys; Transportation routes; Urban transportation; Automated fare collection; Empirical investigation; Household travel surveys; Origin destination; Origin destination matrices; Penetration rates; Transportation researchers; Travel behaviour analysis; comparative study; empirical analysis; household survey; matrix; public transport; transportation economics; travel behavior; travel demand; Matrix algebra, Big data; OD matrices; Public transportation; Smart card data; Travel survey",English,Article,263,4,Mobility and Transportation

Through effective urban design, resources can be effectively allocated, balancing economic and environmental development, which is an important means of tourism development in coastal cities. The regional natural and cultural characteristics should be analyzed, because they are important factors in planning and design cases. At present, the functions of coastal cities will become more and more complex, requiring the construction of city characteristics, space humanization, and so on. Urban design is the overall design of the complex system of the city, which pays more attention to the framework creation and the guidance of urban development. Urban design is a multisolution process and a continuous basis system that will feed back dynamic urban governance, which is a professional category that comprehensively deals with system element relations, public value orientation, and high-quality urban environment concepts. The basic concept of urban design consists of mixed functions, land use, public transport, public vitality creation, and medium-and high-density urban texture, which has gradually become a consensus.

Contrasting the collective imaginary with reality,2020,"This article contributes to the analysis of the relationship between urban renewal processes and sustainable development in mature beach destinations and the adoption of smart tourism. It takes as its case study Spanish destinations taking part in publicly-funded projects and plans designed to convert them into so-called ""smart destinations"" (SD). Its chief goals are to identify, through the Delphi technique, the smart tourism narrative behind the drive for creating SD, as well as to see how good a fit this is with the strategic positionings of mature destinations seeking to halt their decline or take on a new lease of life by introducing sustainability measures. Based on a review of the existing literature, we perform a critical analysis of this narrative to expose the contradictions arising when it is applied as a tool for urban renewal based on the implementation of sustainability strategies. The results aid with progress in two directions. Firstly, the article contributes new conceptual elements on the role of SD in the urban transformation of tourist destinations as a response to the challenges of global competitiveness. The second contribution, which is applied in nature and based on the study of a variety of Spanish tourist destinations, analyzes the impact the application of smart tourism-based technological solutions may have upon sustainability. Specifically, it examines the actions of different mass tourism beach destinations and discusses their actual ability to foster renewal in the field of tourism and offer solutions for overcoming urban sustainability problems. Lastly, it offers some recommendations for mature beach destination managers interested in implementing smart tourism projects based on sustainability criteria. © 2020 by the authors.","Beach destinations; Evolution of tourism; Smart tourism; Spanish smart destinations; Sustainability, Spain; beach; competitiveness; Delphi analysis; ecotourism; public spending; tourism development; tourist destination",English,Article,270,3,Urban Sustainability

The current study expands the smart specialisation literature in the context of small-island tourism nations. It also proposes sustainable future growth strategies for these countries. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted structural equation modelling using the data of 14 island nations between 1995 and 2014. The selection of countries was based on a set of criteria borrowed from literature. Findings: The results indicate that the development of ICT infrastructure was not only associated with a higher inflow of tourists and a higher GDP per capita but also with a higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. Results also suggest that higher protection of terrestrial and marine areas has no impact on tourist inflows in tourism countries. Also, higher protection decreases the dependence of the total output on the tourism sector. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of this study is the lack of available macro data on some other relevant variables for the countries studied. Social implications: Following the findings of this study, the governments of these countries should make stringent environmental regulations and relax the telecom regulations for sustainable smart specialisation. Originality/value: This study presents a novel insight into the sustainability challenge of island nations through the lens of smart specialisation. It also contributes to the literature on ICT and development. © 2019, Korak Bhaduri and Shivendra Pandey.",", ICT; Island nations; Smart specialization; Sustainability; Technology; Tourism",English,Article,246,11,Rural Resource Management

It used to be the northeastern boundary of central China with an array of military cities and fortresses intensively built for military defence. Unlike palaces and gentry residences, vernacular residences and urban tissue existing widely in historical towns are excluded in the national protection schedule and have thus experienced different levels of damages. They feature a paradox that the general city form is well preserved whilst architectural forms are changed to a large extent. Most vernacular buildings have endured centennial baptisms, as evidenced by their architectural layouts, structures, roofing, walls, decorations etc. As most historical Chinese cities are not renowned tourist destinations, they are faced with various threats and are on the verge of extinction. The threats include the departure of young residents, decay of historical architecture, insufficient financial and technical support for architectural renovation, improper modifications by residents and demolition of entire historical neighbourhoods. Such threats are widespread in Chinese historical cities which are struggling to survive. Prior to the implementation of professional interventions, the urban forms and vernacular architecture of such historical cities should be studied. Through on-site investigation and query of historical data, especially the historical satellite city maps of U.S. Geological Survey, this study analyses the current life conditions in the context of traditional architecture, reveals problems in the use of historical architecture, identifies potential threats and summarises the underlying reasons. Suggestions benefitting local architectural conservation are then put forward. © Authors 2020.

57209028149; 55825091600; 37121489500,Fiction or reality? Hotel leaders’ perception on climate action and sustainable business models,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the perceptions of key actors in the Caribbean’s hotel industry on the development of business models that are inclusive of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and resilient to climate change challenges. The objectives are to gain a better understanding of the central actors’ perspective and to explore the potential of scenario thinking as a pragmatic tool to provoke deep and practical reflections on business model innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a questionnaire survey conducted via email to senior personnel in the hotel industry across the region as well as to national and regional tourism and hospitality associations/agencies and government ministries. The questionnaire used a mix of close- and open-ended questions, as well as fictional scenarios to gain insight about perceptions from key actors in the tourism sector, including respondents’ personal beliefs about the reality of climate science and the need for action at the levels of individuals, governments, local, regional and multinational institutions. Findings: The study found that while the awareness of climate change and willingness to action is high, respondents perceive that hotels are not prepared for the climate crisis. Respondents had an overall view that the hotel sector in the Caribbean was unprepared for the negative impacts of climate change. Recommendations from the study include the need for immediate action on the part of all to both raise awareness and implement focused climate action to secure the future of tourism in the Caribbean. Research limitations/implications: The use of a survey has considerable challenges, including low response rates and the limitations of using perceptions to understand a phenomenon. The survey was conducted across the Caribbean from The Bahamas to Belize and down to Trinidad and Tobago so that views from across the similar, yet diverse, regions could be gathered, included and compared for a comprehensive view of perceptions and possible ideas for climate smart action. Practical implications: The 2030 Agenda for SDGs is based on policy and academic debates. This study helps to bridge the academic and policy discussion with the needs of the industry. Originality/value: This study contributes a consideration for climate-resilient business models for hotels in the tourism industry as a definitive action toward achieving SDG 13. This combined with the use of fictional climate change scenarios to access perceptions about the future of the hotel industry in the light of climate change, adds originality to the study. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",", Business models; Climate action; Fictional scenarios; Questionnaire survey; SDGs; Sustainable tourism",English,Article,407,11,Rural Resource Management

Domenico Church in Matera's ""Sassi"": A multiscale perspective to built heritage conservation",2020,"Architectural heritage is perhaps the most important marker of the Italian and European landscapes. Over the last decades, its strategic relevance for local economic development has led to prioritize tourism-oriented promotion objectives. Therefore, new light has been thrown on once unknown resources that have thus received the attention of tourists interested in new visit experiences. To this end, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have delivered a crucial support mainly in terms of public attraction and creation of new cultural offers. However, new urgent challenges now face tangible heritage, whose physical existence is jeopardized through extreme events and poor maintenance. Unexpected intense visit flows represent in themselves a further threat for sensitive heritages. ICTs have then to cope with more complex conservation tasks and the Internet of Things (IoT) can facilitate appropriate solutions. The paper presents a smart sensor-based infrastructure for the structural monitoring of S. Domenico Church in Matera, an emblematic city for the concerns described, which also highlighted the need for a wider conservation concept also embracing context and fruition issues. The article introduces the case study and its delicate environment, and the technological background of heritage monitoring solutions; the proposed IoT infrastructure is then described, discussing its potentialities and IoT contribution to creating more holistic and multiscale perspectives to heritage conservation. © 2020 by the authors.","5G; Built heritage; Data interoperability; FIWARE; Heritage conservation; IoT smart infrastructure; Sensor networks, Basilicata; Italy; Matera; architectural design; economic development; ecotourism; heritage conservation; historic building; sensor; World Wide Web",English,Article,218,3,Urban Sustainability

We analyse whether and to what extent the quality of government policies in handling the health aspects of the crisis influence cross-country differences in the economic impact of the pandemic as projected by the OECD, the IMF and the World Bank. We measure policy quality by a recently published Economist Intelligence Unit index and a COVID-19 Misery index combining the stringency of government-imposed distancing measures with the COVID-19 fatality rate. Moreover, we control for international spillovers captured by trade openness and export exposure to tourism. Results for most specifications show that good government performance pays off as the respective countries record less severe revisions of growth forecasts. Only in a few cases, our findings suggest that the pandemic’s global effect might be so strong that actions by individual governments do not affect cross-country differences of growth revisions. Finally, there is broad evidence supporting the view that a country’s exposure to the global economy influences its growth outlook relative to other countries. © 2020, The Author(s).",,English,Article,177,11,Rural Resource Management

First, we model the trajectory of natural gas prices in Asia, Northern America, and Europe using a Threshold Vector AutoRegression representation (TVAR) in which the system's dynamics switches back and forth between high and low regimes of oil price volatility. We then use the generalized impulse response functions (GIRF) obtained from the estimated threshold model to analyze the effects of volatility shocks on the regional gas markets dynamics. Lastly, the valuation of destination flexibility in LNG supplies is conducted using a real option approach. We generate a sample of possible future regional price trajectories using Monte Carlo simulations of our empirical model and determine for each trajectory the optimal shipping decisions and their profitability. Our results portend a substantial source of profit for the industry and reveal future movements of vessels.

55365378500,"Variety, smart specialization and tourism competitiveness",2020,"This work analyzes how regional tourism dynamics (demand, supply and specialization) and innovation performance may influence tourism competitiveness. The novelty and originality of the analysis is the inclusion of aspects related to the sectorial priority options defined within smart specialization strategies in European regions as potential explanatory factors. By using a panel data model and focusing on regions where tourism is one of the priority sectors for Regional Innovation Strategies (RIS3, 2014–2020), the results reveal positive impacts of tourism demand, supply and specialization on the value added produced by tourism activities. Moreover, immaterial aspects related to the qualification of the regional labor force and innovation dynamics (investment in research in development) also exert a positive impact on tourism competitiveness. The novel results obtained regarding the impacts of smart specialization strategies show a high potential of the tourism sector to benefit from geographical, cultural and institutional forms of proximity.

However, other factors such as Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, the sustainability index, fuel consumption, and travel costs are not considered. Therefore, more comprehensive methods need to be implemented to improve transportation systems and support users' decision making in their daily commute. This paper addresses current challenges by utilizing data analytics derived from our proposed mobile application. The proposed application quantifies various factors of each transportation mode including but not limited to the cost, trip duration, fuel consumption, and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions. All calculated travel costs are based on the real-time gas prices and toll fees. The users are also able to navigate to their destination and update the total travel costs in real-time. The emissions data per trip basis are aggregated to provide analytics of emissions usage. The traffic data is collected for the Southern California region and the effectiveness of the application is evaluated by twenty participants from California State University, Long Beach. The results demonstrate the application's impacts on users' decision-making and the propriety of the factors used in route selection.

Towards smart heritage management,2020,"Providing public access to heritage promotes a social interest in its conservation but, at the same time, it poses a risk to the conservation of resources. The biggest challenge in managing public use of heritage is to establish a sustainable relationship between heritage and tourism. The multidisciplinary teams involved in visitor flow management generate and exchange information about the heritage property without an integrative vision. The lack of a reliable, unified and up-to-date source of information generally hinders decision-making, causes errors and leads to inappropriate practices in heritage visitor flow management, thereby putting the conservation of resources at risk because of the impacts derived from visitation while the quality experience is also affected. Building Information Modelling (BIM) provides a collaborative framework where multidisciplinary teams share geometric and documentary information about the building in a coordinated way. This tool applied to heritage (HBIM) is demonstrating how it is able to improve efficiency in documenting, intervening and managing heritage. Beyond these aforementioned skills, the objective of this study is to identify the potential of HBIM to improve the efficiency of the visitor flow management. The methodology includes a literature review, qualitative data collection and technical documentation analysis. The results indicate that the use of HBIM can optimise the planning and management of visitor flows, by virtually foreseeing the possible risks derived from visits. It can also calculate recreational carrying capacity and analyse alternatives to itineraries that minimise the deterioration of the most fragile spaces. © Authors 2020.

In this paper, the development of carbon dioxide transport via pipeline is systematically reviewed from four aspects: pipeline design, process, risk and safety, standard and specification. The results reveal that there are many similarities between the carbon dioxide pipeline and the natural gas pipeline, but due to different gas compositions and transportation destinations, the transport process, design, and construction considerations are quite different. Especially in terms of management, the specifications and standards for carbon dioxide pipelines are still minimal, the techno-economic framework and integrity management system are still immature. In addition, this paper summaries the challenges and future directions of carbon dioxide transport via pipeline. It is concluded that the studies on the influence of impurities on phase equilibrium and corrosion mechanisms in carbon dioxide pipeline are challenges, and the new construction and detection technologies are also crucial.

This activity can be a ""smart chance"" for the sustainability of the mountain rural environment, because it has a multiplier effect on some important parts of economic and social life of the community. For instance, it can be an ally of agriculture, ensuring a diversification alternative for farms, an alternative for local guesthouses to capitalize their own local products, while ensuring the opportunity to obtain additional/complementary income, a possibility of adjusting the depopulation phenomenon and the abandonment of old houses and lands, at the same time offering a pleasant activity/alternative, especially for young people. In this context, the purpose followed in the paper is oriented through the transposition of agritourism activity into a ""smart chance"" for ensuring rural mountain sustainability.

However, data from surveys or travel diaries that were traditionally used for travel mode-choice modeling are costly and have certain inaccuracies and cover limited populations. Therefore, recently, smart card data collected from automated fare collection systems have gradually become more popular for travel behavior analysis and modeling, but relatively little attention has been paid to investigating the daily variability in travel behavior decisions using more than 1-year smart card data, apart for some descriptive studies. In this study, mode-choice behaviors in public transit were investigated in Seoul using 20-month smart card data to investigate the daily variability in the ratio of the number of subway passengers depending on origin and destination. For this aim, the effects of temporal features such as weather and calendar events as well as the route information and built environments of origin and destination stations were considered on a daily basis for different time periods. To overcome the limitation that the purpose of travel cannot be identified from smart card data, this study attempted to precisely estimate subway connections and extract travel records for commuting from regular commuters' cards. The models were trained using 1-year data and were validated using 8-month data, which verified that the selected factors explain the daily variability in mode-choice behaviors for public transportation. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",", Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Railroads; Smart cards; Transportation routes; Automated fare collection; Descriptive studies; Origin and destinations; Public transportation; Route information; Temporal features; Transportation planning; Travel mode choice model; commuting; decision making; public transport; spatial analysis; transportation planning; transportation system; travel behavior; Population statistics",English,Article,230,4,Mobility and Transportation

To assess the distinctive impact of economic downturns on population dynamics, the present study illustrates the results of an exploratory analysis that assesses urban expansion and rural decline at various temporal scales in Greece, a peripheral country in southeastern Europe. Statistical analysis based on multivariate exploratory techniques outlined the persistent increase of regional populations, evidencing the distinctive role of agglomeration/scale with urbanization and early suburbanization phases (1940-1980) and accessibility/amenities with late suburbanization and re-urbanization phases (1981-2019). Recession accompanied (and, in some way, consolidated) the decline of agglomeration economies, leading to counter-urbanization in some cases. As an indirect result of counter-urbanization, the population increased more rapidly in low-density coastal areas with moderate accessibility and tourism specialization. Consistently, settlement expansion has altered the persistent gap in central and peripheral locations.

Regular travelers- information extracted from smart card data (SCD) have been extensively analyzed. However, rare studies have been devoted to non-roundtrips, which account for a relatively large portion of the overall transit ridership, especially in metropolises such as Beijing. This study aimed to reveal the non-roundtrip pattern using the passenger travel data obtained from SCD. Weekly non-roundtrip SCD were used to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of overall and typical non-roundtrips- origins and destinations (ODs). Also, subway data and bus data were combined and visualized in geographic information system (GIS). The reasons for frequent non-roundtrips generated in the metropolitan city were inferred. The results demonstrate some detected spatiotemporal patterns of non-roundtrips. It is not surprising that a large proportion of non-roundtrips serve as a rail access to intercity, but there are still many trips of this kind showing a commuting pattern. Merging SCD with bus data, the results also reveal that passengers may choose other modes as a substitute return transportation option due to rail fare or overcrowding problem. This study focused on irregular trips normally neglected in the literature and found that the number of these trips is too large to be ignored in a diversified city like Beijing.

In order to meet the travel requirements in the intelligent era, it is necessary to improve the market competitiveness of the taxi industry. This paper proposes a sharing pricing model based on the rate balancing between the driver and passenger. The main concept adopts the dynamic request method for the passengers to take the ride-sharing taxi. For the first passenger's request the nearest taxi receives the request, picks up the passenger on time and drives according to the shortest path calculated by Floyd algorithm. When other passengers ask for a drive, the driver will choose the passengers according to the taxi seat capacity to complete the ride-sharing process until all the passengers arrive at the destination. In the calculation of the driver's income and the passenger's costs we consider the driving conditions in different time periods and use the optimal solution of the model to make a sharing price. Finally, the driver's income and the passengers' costs are compared and analyzed under three driving modes which are the common taxi, Didi express and ride-sharing taxi. The results show that the dynamic sharing pricing model designed in this paper is reasonable and very effective in daily life. © 2020 IEEE.","Billing algorithm; Floyd algorithm; Intelligent transportation; Multiplication mode; Rate equalization, Competition; Taxicabs; Tourism industry; Driving conditions; Dynamic request; Dynamic sharing; Floyd algorithm; Optimal solutions; Pricing models; Rate balancing; Shortest path; Costs",English,Conference paper,214,4,Mobility and Transportation

Moreover cities around the world are increasingly recognizing the smart tourism city concept and related strategies as means of optimizing sustainable environments. Particularly for cities facing emerging issues of residents' negative perceptions towards tourism, smart tourism city empowers a city to rise to this challenge by creating urban spaces that residents and visitors can enjoy together. However, smart tourism city research initiatives still fail to address the full spectrum of related and potential developments. This study presents a conceptual approach to defining smart tourism city: the smart city and its components are defined and contrasted with smart tourism and its components. The resulting convergence-smart tourism city-is then examined in light of a number of pioneering examples of smart tourism cities and its vital roles in the age of sustainable development.

In 2011 fieldwork which asked the extent of agreement with several statements was carried out. A descriptive analysis was carried out on the data obtained to determine the average valuation on various items and cross tabulations to see if there are differences between the five municipalities of the island. The results show that there is a high valuation of the economic benefits and tourism is considered to be very important, but they are half-hearted or critical towards the rest of the impacts. In addition, there are no significant differences between the five municipalities. Ibiza is a single tourist destination and works as one single social unit.

The current increase of last mile delivery is the impact of increasing home delivery services in areas that see a growing development of e-commerce. There are several issues in the operational process, including the high number of trips taken from parcel delivery service. One of the innovations used to solve these issues is the smart locker system. The objective of this research is to analyze the characteristics and efficiency of the smart locker system that has been running in Jabodetabek to reduce the trips taken for home delivery service. Data analysis was performed using the travel diary data of a single smart locker operator. Results showed that the use of smart locker is not without faults and causes the performance of each transit hub (as a part of a trip chain of smart lockers) to significantly differ. One issue includes the variable of waiting time either at the pickup or at the delivery of shipments. Another issue is that the coverage area for each locker is not the same, thus affecting the performance of each transit hub. In terms of delivery trip length, the use of the smart locker is 30.65% more efficient when compared to parcel delivery service. In order to deliver 222 items, the total trip length for parcel delivery is 717.8 km, while using the smart locker requires a total trip length of 497.83 km. © 2020, Novel Carbon Resource Sciences.

While various OD estimation methods using the trip-chaining approach have been developed in recent years, the validity of these estimation methods has not extensively been investigated. This study examines the errors in OD estimation caused by inaccurate inference of alighting stops, to improve the accuracy of the existing trip-chaining algorithms. The distribution of errors is evaluated both at the stop level and the public transport zonal level, given the geographical attributes of each zone and the attributes of the smartcard transactions. While the results show significant associations between zone attributes as well as transaction attributes and the alighting stop inference errors, they undermine the existing algorithm’s assumption that ‘travellers alight a public transport service at a stop which is the closest to their next boarding stop’. Accordingly, this study proposes and evaluates the application of a probabilistic approach using neural networks to infer alighting stops based on a combination of transactional and public transit network attributes. The proposed method is validated using 138,122 smartcard transactions obtained during a normal day in Southeast Queensland, Australia. The results show that our method can improve the accuracy of the existing algorithm by inferring the exact location of 79.5% of the alighting stops and reducing the mean alighting estimation error from 1689 to 503 m for incorrectly estimated alighting stops. At the zonal level, the proposed method also improves the accuracy of the existing algorithm by more than 5%. Finally, the study provides both researchers and practitioners with a method to improve the accuracy of the trip-chaining algorithm and OD estimation, and presents a list of practical guidelines for more effective planning and operation of public transit services. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Alighting stop inference; Deep learning; Error distribution; Neural network; Origin–destination (OD) estimation; Public transport; Smartcard data; Trip-chaining method, Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Errors; Neural networks; Smart cards; Urban transportation; Alighting stop inference; Error distributions; Public transport; Smartcard datum; Trip-chaining method; Inference engines",English,Article,307,4,Mobility and Transportation

After consumption, goods end-up in local waste streams and landfilled because of poorly developed waste management systems. This paper proposes a methodology to extend responsibility to exporting country manufacturers for indirect waste disposal in developing countries through imported goods. It establishes a functional relationship between the weight and volume of the imported goods and the local municipal solid waste stream derived from their consumption, by adapting the recycling concepts of by-product and co-product to the municipal solid waste stream derived from the household sector. A lexicon is formalized to conceptualize an extended-producer-responsibility information system operating at the global level between exporting and importing countries. This EPR system i) determines the recyclability, reusability and treatability attributes of imported goods based on their constitutive parts (primary package or product), as well as the material value as per the net value in the global waste market and final destination once consumed, ii) defines specific conditions regarding the goods´ materials value and structural configuration of their constitutive parts for inclusion in Free-Trade Agreement clauses, and iii) checks for the fulfilment of these proposed conditions. The proposed methodology was validated with a case study on Panama. It was found that 24%(w/w)-34.5%(v/v) of valued materials derived from goods imported in Panama through FTAs could be exported back to the country of origin, 18%(w/w)-2.8%(v/v) could be locally reused, and 58%(w/w)-62.5%(v/v) locally valorized.

The OD (origination-destination) travel time of passengers reflects the temporal and spatial distribution of passenger flow. It is helpful to improve the flow efficiency of passengers and the sustainable development of the city. It is an urgent problem to select appropriate indexes to evaluate OD travel time and analyze the correlation of these indexes. More than one million OD records are generated by the AFC (Auto Fare Collection) system of Nanjing metro every day. A complex network method is proposed to evaluate and analyze OD travel time. Five working days swiping data of Nanjing metro are selected. Firstly, inappropriate data are filtered through data preprocessing. Then, the OD travel time indexes can be divided into three categories: time index, complex network index, and composite index. Time index includes use time probability, passenger flow between stations, average time between stations, and time variance between stations. The complex network index is based on two models: Space P and ride time, including the minimum number of rides, and the shortest ride time. Composite indicators include inter site flow efficiency and network flow efficiency. Based on the complex network model, this research quantitatively analyzes the Pearson correlation of the indexes of OD travel time. This research can be applied to other public transport modes in combination with big data of public smart cards. This will improve the flow efficiency of passengers and optimize the layout of the subway network and urban space. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Complex network; Correlation; Origination-destination; Travel time, Nanjing [Jiangsu]; correlation; index method; network analysis; public transport; spatial distribution; sustainable development; travel time",English,Article,264,4,Mobility and Transportation

In Latin America their use has thrived to access archaeological sites in the Andes, but also in urban environments for mass transit. Despite some apparent benefits of these systems, the current literature is scarce in terms of quantifying the environmental profile of cable cars. Hence, their environmental performance as compared to other means of transport remains essentially unexplored. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to provide a comparative environmental analysis, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, of the two existing transport methods to visit the Kuelap Archaeological Complex, in northern Peru: a recently built cableway system and the alternative unpaved winding road. An attributional LCA perspective was performed for several impact categories, including global warming and particulate matter formation. In addition, a scenario analysis and an uncertainty analysis, using Monte Carlo simulation, were conducted to account for deterministic and stochastic results interpretation. Results demonstrated that succulent environmental benefits are attained when cable cars substitute road transport in complex Andean orographic conditions.

26967872000,Kidnappings of international tourists in Nigeria: Impacts on the hospitality sector,2020,"Nigeria is facing all sorts of criminal and safety problems, one of which is kidnapping which seems to be very rampant and predominant in the country. The hospitality sector and in particular, the lodging and hotel accommodation seems to be most affected by kidnapping phenomenon in Nigeria. This is said against the backdrop that mostly, international tourists visiting and touring in Nigeria would be lodged in a hotel that have been reserved for them. The concern is that, these days, these hotels are no safer for foreign tourists in view of the constant and persistent kidnapping taking place in different parts of Nigeria. Apart from the lodgings being unsafe, it is also very dangerous for foreign tourists visiting Nigeria to use road transportation to their hotel accommodation or to go touring anywhere in Nigeria as these roads are also targeted by kidnappers. Most of the attempts at kidnapping in lodgings are often successful as the kidnappers work in collaboration with hotel workers and car hire services drivers who avail the kidnappers with necessary information about the movement, accommodation and destinations of the victims, mostly foreign visitors or tourists. Most of the perpetrators and those who provide information to them kidnap international tourists based on the belief that huge sum of money shall be paid as ransom by their family or their home government for their release. What is more disturbing and worrisome is that sometimes, the law enforcement agents, particularly the police officers are complicit in kidnapping by either being involved in the plot or blatantly refused to take any step or action to secure the release of kidnapped tourist hence raising the questions of being incompetent or complicit. In conclusion, this paper postulates that the issues of kidnapping of foreign tourists should be tackled and combated. To achieve this, government should unleash its various securities apparatus and personnel to preempt through intelligence, arrest and successfully prosecute kidnappers when they are caught. © 2020.

In particular, the performance of 45 buildings in this region were measured and quantified in terms of life cycle based carbon footprint, life cycle costs, heat loss rate, number of guests, energy consumption, and area. Buildings were classified into three types: traditional, semi-modern and modern. The statistical analysis included testing for significant differences between such categories by means of ANOVA, and determination of the correlation between the same parameters. Results show a significant difference between the buildings’ total carbon footprint and operation stage carbon footprint while, there is no significant difference between the buildings’ life cycle costs. Traditional buildings have on average the largest carbon footprint and life-cycle cost over the typical building lifespan of 50 years of building lifespan. The ANOVA tests highlight how heat loss rate, size of the building and number of tourists in the hotels are significantly different across the building types. A strong positive correlation is observed between environmental impact, economic impact and energy consumption for the household activities, and a negative correlation with the number of guests and building size. By considering several buildings, this study allows to draw new and more general conclusions about effective sustainability strategies in the whole hotel sector in the Himalayan region. In particular, it shows that reducing impacts in the operation stage should be highly prioritized, focusing on reducing energy consumption and heat loss and shifting to the use of renewable energy sources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Carbon footprint; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Heat losses; Heating; Hotels; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing; National parks; Reducing energy consumption; Sustainability performance; Sustainability strategies; Sustainable building; Use of renewable energies; Energy conservation, Energy consumption; Heat loss rate; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Sagarmatha national park; Sustainable building",English,Article,271,11,Rural Resource Management

As a solution, in this article, we develop a novel energy-efficient system which would help commuters navigate through their journey safely. Along with making them aware of any upcoming points of concerns (PoCs) such as sudden bumps, sharp turns, and bad roads, we also inform commuters about the expected time of arrival at the destination.

Rural tourism development may become a new important stimulus for promoting a sustainable transformation of the farmers' livelihood. This calls for a smart specialization in rural tourism where the focus is on a balanced rural revitalization strategy. As part of the empirical research, this paper introduces a livelihood sustainability index. This index helps to construct a balanced system for the evaluation of livelihood sustainability achievements in rural tourism destinations. It is based on livelihood capital, livelihood strategy, and the interlinkage between livelihood and environment, in order to dynamically assess the livelihood sustainability of rural households. Taking Huangpi District of the Wuhan area in China as our applied case study, the livelihood sustainability index appears to show over the past years a significant rise, based on a comprehensive index method, an entropy method, and a coupling coordination model. Our findings show that the development of rural tourism has clearly promoted livelihood sustainability. This has inter alia resulted in the accumulation of livelihood capital, an asset of which both social and cultural capital have benefitted greatly; livelihood strategies have also improved, and therefore so have livelihood diversity and stability; and finally, the interlinkage and coordination degree between livelihood and the environment has also changed positively from a primary to intermediate balanced development. However, the livelihood sustainability index in the area concerned is still relatively low, and has not yet reached its possible optimal level. Hence, there is still much room for improvement. Various approaches can be proposed to achieve a more sustainable livelihood, such as enhancing livelihood capital; narrowing the economic gap between farmers by participating in professional tourism activity; establishing the mechanism of industrial integration and the development of rural eco-tourism; and coordinating a balanced development of livelihood and environmental quality. © 2020 by the authors.","China; assessment method; cultural capital; ecotourism; index method; livelihood; modeling; rural development; strategic approach; sustainability; tourism; tourism development; tourist destination; urbanization, Livelihood sustainability index; Rural ecological environment; Rural revitalization strategy; Rural tourism; Smart specialization; Sustainable livelihoods",English,Article,312,11,Rural Resource Management

A methodological proposal in Sardinia (Italy),2020,"Spatial planning and territorial promotion can benefit largely from the application of the Information Communication Technology (ICT) at different scales. From knowledge acquisition to management and planning, their role in building an image of the territory, and constantly updating it to the benefit of users and planners, is of paramount importance. Institutional channels, together with social networks, are the means by which both a local community and a wider community of users share experiences and perceptions. ICTs are therefore strategic in supporting and promoting a sustainable tourism development of territories. Data and information aggregators as dashboards represent examples of decision support systems where digital data are organized and processed to produce an information output. The present paper is part of a wider research, related to the valorization of a former mining area in the Sulcis-Iglesiente area (Sardinia, Italy), where the extraction activity has left the place to abandonment, and only recently to tourism, stressing the concept of slow tourism. Such new opportunity has been launched with the Santa BarbaraWalk (SBW), an ancient mining route currently trying to consolidate as a tourism attraction area. Such a territory is in constant transition with unique characters of anthropic and naturalistic characterization, setting itself as a green infrastructure, capable also of attracting a wide community of regional and extra-regional users. However, its digital network-consisting of intangible infrastructure and flows-is fragmented in terms of policies and contents. Additionally, a state of disorganization in slow tourism promotion activities can be observed. To implement the SBW capabilities, the present paper aims to develop a proposal for the framework of a circular dashboard applied to the SBW. In particular, we implement a set of indicators of performance of the SBW for the organization of information on the walk's main characters, to facilitate a shared governance and an effective tourism promotion. The SBW is recognized as a network connecting the main points of interest preferred by the slow tourism (This paper is based on the Research project TSULKI-Tourism and Sustainability in the Sulcis (Sardinia-Italy)-and on the agreement protocol between DICAAR Department of Cagliari University and Foundation of the Santa BarbaraWalk, signed in December 2018). © 2020 by the authors.","Green infrastructure; Italy; Landscape; Santa barbara walk; Sardinia; Slow tourism; Smart dashboard; Smart governance; Sulcis-Iglesiente, Italy; ecotourism; greenspace; knowledge; methodology; tourism; tourism development; tourism management; tourist attraction",English,Article,360,3,Urban Sustainability

One of the most important tasks is to protect the area from noise, pollution, and vibration caused by transport. Currently, over 30,000 vehicles cross the Old Town core daily, most of which do not have a destination in the Old Town, and drivers only use a shorter route to connect within the city. To this purpose, the Vilnius City Municipality has developed a Loop Traffic Scheme in the Old Town of Vilnius, which allows only loop traffic, i.e. for entry/exit to/from a specific restricted area. The main purpose of the article is the discussion and evaluation of measures how the Old Town area can be returned to the people (i.e., pedestrians, cyclists, public transport) to minimize traffic flows and eliminate transit traffic. To achieve smart solutions and to open public spaces for Old Town residents and visitors, we compare different traffic organization and parking measures, analyse their efficiency. We propose integrating innovative technological solutions and smart tools (parking, ridesharing system, integrated pedestrian and bicycle routes, smart traffic control, etc.) by using the best practices of other cities.

This abundance is because it is supported by high temperatures, rainfall, moisture, light intensity, and rapid organic cycling along a year in the tropical regions. Moist tropical forests are blessed without anyone planting, maintaining, and disturbing them in the long-term periods, so they can function as the lungs of the world to provide oxygen and maintain the earth’s climate. Although biological productivity is 10 times, the economic value is only half compared to temperate ecosystems. The new paradigm from extraction into the empowerment of natural resources will provide new challenges to move from the red and green economic concept to the blue economic concept with added values of economy, socio-culture, and environment aspect for sustainable development. The synergism between biological resources (flora, fauna, human) and land resources (land, minerals, water, air, microclimate) by the development of Integrated Bio-cycle Management (IBM) through empowerment of life cycle assessment as a closed-to-natural ecosystem would manage our tropical natural resources through multifunctional and multi-product system. Information about agroecosystem, life cycle assessment, biowaste, bioenergy, bioeconomy on tropical natural resources would give valuable concepts for sustainable development of smart tropical agroecosystem management. This integrated farming system can produce food, feed, fiber, fertilizer, wood, energy, water, oxygen, medicine, mysticism, and tourism, so they have added values in environmental, economic, socio-cultural, and health aspects.

57113627100,Evaluating the Aerotropolis Model for African Cities: The Case of the Durban Aerotropolis,2020,"A new approach to airport development and associated industrial and commercial land use in its immediate surroundings is gaining prominence around the world, which has become known as the Aerotropolis Model. An aerotropolis is a “smart city” precinct being developed in the surrounding area of an airport, and focusing on business developments in the so-called “first mile” and also in rapid and world-class logistics and connectivity to suppliers, customers, and partners locally and globally. Aerotropoli and their associated business usually flourish in the fields of innovative, high-technology and high value-added sectors, and with business links that are mostly foreign in nature. So, apart from the notion that an aerotropolis can become a fully integrated and modern smart city, they flourish and focus on logistics and commercial facilities and services that emanate from and support aviation-linked enterprise. The plan is that the Durban Aerotropolis will seek to become a unique entry point for the South African and regional tourism industry, and that tourists desiring to visit will be one of the major strategies to increase passenger flows, as well as investors desiring a high return on investment and becoming strategic production and export champions in the region. This chapter looks at evaluating the aerotropolis concept and also assesses the impact that aerotropolis developments could have on African cities of the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Aerotropolis; Innovation; Large-scale urban developments (LSUDs); Local economic development (LED); Smart cities; Urban governance models",English,Book chapter,226,3,Urban Sustainability
57211467610; 57207843852; 57336760600,Role of authorities and smart city in empowering the small tourism enterprises,2020,"Until recently, the massive introduction of the digital technologies took place mainly in the form of global reservation systems and payment systems. Mobile Internet and Wi-Fi technology enabled tourists to quickly and efficiently receive information on the objects of tourist interest and on tourism organizations, which increased competition in the industry. However, only the large and financially sustainable tourism organizations can afford the large-scale introduction of “smart technologies”, while the most of the tourism infrastructure enterprises are small businesses. In 2018, the Administration of St. Petersburg launched a pilot project Web portal “Passportization of the urban amenities of St. Petersburg” as an element of Smart City. Even at the first stage, the authorities were able to evaluate and expand the idea of existing tourism infrastructure of small forms, identify attractions that were not previously included in any tourist information source, and so on. As a result, the authorities of the region, when conducting major events can actively use small infrastructure facilities to distribute tourist flows evenly and change quickly public transportation routes. The article summarizes the experience of city authorities in building Smart City and its impact on changing tourism infrastructure in the region. For the active use of the “smart technologies” by small tourism enterprises, it is crucial to facilitate the access to resources, which is impossible without the participation of authorities. St. Petersburg’s experience in managing amenities combined with the open interaction of all the stakeholders (government, business, city residents, etc.) can be of interest and of use for developing and optimizing the use of tourism infrastructure in other cities. © the authors, 2020.

24466730100,STeMA: A Sustainable Territorial Economic/Environmental Management Approach,2020,"The STeMA-TIA model has been devised to support an integrated strategic vision of general, territorialised and sectoral policies at all decision-making levels. This assessment tool was created within the context of spatial planning and as part of the territorial dimension of the European Strategies. STeMA-TIA is based on an original qualitative-quantitative methodological approach comprising 10 simplifying hypotheses and 9 logical steps. It develops along interactive coaxial matrices (indicators-policies-effects), which return ex ante and ex post results and maps. It was fruitfully applied to the Territorial Dimension within the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy, the Territorial Cohesion Policy, and National and Regional Operative Plans 2020, as well as to Italian structural reforms at the metropolitan and regional level. The strength of this tool lies in its flexibility and ability to combine different indicators related to economic, social, environmental, cultural, organisational and financial dimensions, which assess Territorial Impact Assessment in relation to original Systemic Territorial Functional Typologies. One existing weakness of STeMA-TIA is that, during a pairwise comparison process, identifying indicators such as ‘dominant’ and ‘secondary’ may not always be straightforward. Further developments and applications may help overcome this limitation. Future applications of STeMA-TIA include using it to measure Territorial Cohesion within green economy policies at the national-regional level or to evaluate the post-2020 Europe strategy, cultural heritage and tourist strategies via Innovative Technologies and within Smart Specialisation Strategy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", European sustainable policies; STeMA; Territorial impact assessment",English,Book chapter,230,3,Urban Sustainability
58308175200; 7801338135,Smart Mobility and Sustainable Tourism in Urban Areas: Two Case Studies in the South of Italy,2020,"Sustainable tourism has a significant effect on other socio-economic sectors and on the environment, prompting the adoption of smart solutions for infrastructure and public services. However, the effect of tourism on the environment remains problematic, because the carrying capacity of many important tourism destinations has been exceeded in recent years. Mobility is one of the main drivers impacting the environment in urban development scenarios. Several cities in the south of Italy are characterised by poor and inefficient urban transport. The inefficiency of urban transport damages key economic sectors such as tourism and is responsible for urban degradation by reducing air quality and increasing CO2 emissions, with a significant impact on the quality of life, human health and ecosystem integrity. This chapter analyses the interaction between mobility and tourism with reference to urban development scenarios inspired by the technological solutions introduced by smart cities. This chapter evaluates two case studies, that is, the municipalities of Castel Volturno and Lecce, comparing the adoption of technological innovations and new end-user engagement policies. The two case studies are analysed by means of a modified driver–pressure–state–impact–response (DPSIR) analysis framework (OECD. Environmental indicators—development measurement and use—2003, 2003), whose results are the identification of (1) measures to be implemented with the active engagement of local communities and stakeholders; (2) policy options to be included in the “Strategic Plans” for sustainable urban development according to New Urban Agenda (NUA) paradigm (New Urban Agenda—Habitat III.

57188983697,Smart cities and infrastructure standardization requirements,2020,"Globally, select cities are working on transforming themselves to smart cities. India has decided to leapfrog in this area and started to implement 100 smart cities in Phase-I where the work on building these cities has already began. The framework for these smart cities is divided into two major parts. The first part has some basic requirements that all smart cities need to fulfill, and the second is specific to needs, location, or the history of issues to be solved in that city. In addition, based on the geographical location of the city, the smart-city proposals additionally include the areas that specifically work on the business, social, and economic requirements of that city. In case of any previous history of natural calamity in city, the proposals furthermore work on plans to reduce the impact of disasters in cities. This chapter attempts to first bring in need for standardization by collating some of the basic requirements of smart cities, keeping data security guidelines in mind, and comes with a usable list of applications, which can benefit from open architecture and infrastructure standardization. When used at national level, this open architecture and standardization can provide aggregated information at the national level. Additionally, reusability of applications and processes across various smart cities makes the extension of similar applications to other smart cities faster and at lower costs. Standardization together with open smart-city architecture also brings out the need and delivery of “community-led innovation” environment. However the work requires data managers who work with the head of city or the mayor and with the central agencies at the central level and can help in creating these innovations on the data.

With the new Smart City technologies, companies benefit from much more effective promotion. The solutions adopt an appeal to the latest technological and digital innovations. The SMART component of a city has evolved rapidly in recent years from a possibility to a necessity, included in the urban development strategies. Sensors with minimal energy consumption, Wifi networks, digital surveillance, automatic data flow processing, and public service management systems are just a few examples of digitization and opportunities for smart cities. The smart city emphasizes the ability of local government to collaborate with other organizations (IT companies, local communities, local business environment) to develop and adopt better policies; to maximize the benefits of a strategic partnership. Is also an urban policy option in which the public value is continuously pursued as an essential condition for success. According to studies and analysis, the urban challenge of today is to think, act, and live SMART.

Social innovations emerge when the state and market in developing countries find it difficult to solve problems such as poverty, hunger, ill health, poor education systems, inadequate drinking water and poor sanitation. These countries also face barriers to economic growth such as climate change, poor governance, unequal opportunities and social exclusion. This volume therefore addresses the following questions. What are the distinctive features of social innovations by cooperatives? How social innovations bring in changes in the process and outcome of development? After presenting theories of social innovation and a critical review of cooperatives and social innovation, the book presents 15 chapters on social innovations by cooperatives in the Asia Pacific region. These social innovations are related to health insurance, community based tourism, disaster response, climate smart agriculture, use of social media for youth empowerment, training for the emergence of second-line leaders in cooperatives, social inclusion through innovative finance, profitable marketing of organic produce to strengthen economic status of small farmers, digital auction and value addition for income security of farmer members, collaboration between cooperative members and workers for the mutual benefit, worker cooperatives, women leadership and participation, building union-cooperative partnership in finance and rating of cooperatives to promote transparency and accountability. A chapter on innovative services of cooperatives during the time of Covid19 is also included.

The northern European urban areas contribute largely to the global economy (maritime flows, energy production, mineral extraction, tourism). While appearing increasingly vulnerable to geopolitical conflicts, they did not consider pollution according to a deterministic approach but as a possibility to redefine their territorial and interterritorial strategies and to initiate new trajectories. How can studying the innovations they have introduced help open up a new perspective on territorial ingenuity and one of its variations, environmental intelligence? Liquid territories, considered as pure or contaminated, seem to participate, at all scales, in the changes and recomposition under way in urban space systems and their transition dynamics. © Armand Colin.","Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Europe; North Sea; geopolitics; innovation; marine pollution; political conflict; territoriality; urban area, Arctic ocean; Baltic sea; City-networks; Determin-ism/Possibilism; Environmental intelligence; North sea; Territorial innovation",French,Article,152,11,Rural Resource Management
57192159564,Some reasons why cities are given extra names; [Las ciudades adjetivadas],2020,"There is an increasing awareness about the importance of the city as a political, legal, social and cultural reality. For a long time now, the city was understood as a place to reach, an Ithaca inspired by a set of rights and freedoms, but lacking a proper and distinctive legal framework. In recent years, the urban space has attracted the attention of scholars and practitioners. Besides the general approach linked to the right to the city, several more specific perspectives propose to focus on particular aspects or city models. Thus notions appear such as heritage, creative, film, smart, touristic, accessible, green or equality-friendly, which are linked to the noun “city”. The underlying reasons for this are manifold and not all of them legal, but the law will always be present here. Therefore, this paper intends to offer a systematic approach to this phenomenon from this legal perspective. © 2020, Iustel.

So, it is a multidisciplinary concept that serves as the basis for a natural development to the next level in the contemporary era of tourism—the smart tourism destination. Ponta Delgada, the largest Azorean city, serves as the motto for this case study. This city, located in a small island territory, is developing a series of efforts based on the smart city paradigm. The research (grounded on an initial survey to test the concept) has shown that the majority of the respondents does not recognize Ponta Delgada as a smart city and is much more concerned about sustainability and mobility, and expects improvements for the city regarding waste and residuals’ treatment; public transportation; green spaces; cycle routes; less cars; and urban infrastructures. On the contrary, the tourism destination promotion is not rated as a priority, although the Strategic Plan for Tourism Development of Ponta Delgada 2017–2021 states the importance of tourism as giving new socioeconomic perspectives and better preparation for sustained success. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Ponta Delgada; Smart city; Smart tourism; Smart tourism destination; The Azores",English,Conference paper,204,3,Urban Sustainability

Before the outbreak of the pandemic, historic cities were subject to large flows of both national and international tourists, in addition to the presence of local workers and residents, thus creating a phenomenon referred to as “overtourism” in international specialised literature, a term that highlights the excesses of an situation that is now out of control. When the lockdown ended, historic cities remained empty. There were no tourists, due to the crisis of human mobility, and there were no public and private office employees, due to widespread smart working practices. This paper deals with the question of whether we should return to the pre-Covid-19 status quo as soon as possible and by making use of public funding, or whether we should take advantage of the effects of the pandemic as an opportunity to modify, partially or totally, the economic and social conditions that led to overtourism. This essay will also analyse the ways in which the phenomenon of overtourism has developed over time, and will also propose the need to drastically reform the ways in which tourism has developed in historic centres. © 2020, eum - Edizioni Universita di Macerata.

Related changes to the higher education landscape are discussed: the 2017 Higher Education Act and creation of a new HE regulator, the Office for Students. How TEF works and some of the consequences of TEF are outlined. As well as discussing what constitutes teaching excellence and what TEF itself is attempting to signal (which includes graduate destinations), we also analyse the underpinning ideologies and logics of choosing metrics to assess teaching excellence, albeit accompanied by peer panel evaluation of institutional written submissions, in determining Gold, Silver and Bronze TEF outcomes. We introduce the notion of TEF as an index rather than a measure. It is suggested that what underlies the English TEF is not about improving teaching but rather an endeavour to pit universities against each other in a highly marketised competitive system with an oversupply of places, in which student debt levels are rising fast. TEF policy is considered with respect to features that would be required of an intelligent accountability system for higher education teaching quality. © 2019, The Author(s).",", Marketisation; Metrics; Policy; Teaching excellence",English,Article,190,4,Mobility and Transportation

Cities as the places of life of human beings and their coexistence with modern technologies could benefit from the implementation of place marketing and branding strategies and from the accepting of new approach to their consumers, predominantly citizens, but also local and international businesses and visitors. This process should be governed by the active and effective co-operation of public authorities, which means a symbiosis of multilateral parties aiming at one goal - a successful and satisfied city users and a destination with modern and effective leadership. For this reason, not only a concept of the effective co-operation is crucial, but also a concept of modern technologies application, for instance a model of smart city or the co-creation principles applied in the fulfilment of service provision to citizens. In order to succeed in competitiveness, it is important to support in destinations the application of the innovative development and sound managerial strategies. This chapter explored a strategy applied in city marketing of one city in Slovakia, Banska Bystrica.

The goal of City Hospitality is to create livability and lovability for the city’s stakeholders – comprising residents, visitors and businesses – by finding synergies between their needs and the city’s offering. However, we see that the excessive growth of travel and tourism has taken a toll on the livability of cities such as Barcelona, Venice and Amsterdam, where there are repeated cases of resident dissatisfaction and government interventions triggered by overcrowdedness. Can the currently conflicting needs of the stakeholders be realigned through the merge of Smart City and City Hospitality? The research identifies residents as an indispensable stakeholder in City Hospitality due to their familiarity with the day-to-day mechanics of the city, leading needs and welcoming behaviour, all of which can create a long-term impact on the hospitality experience perceived by all stakeholders. Research further shows that residents are pivotal to the concept of Smart Community–driven – City Hospitality achieved by a network of empowered residents who participate in, and benefit from the travel and tourism industry through implementing information communication systems.

To ensure the accelerated growth of the tourism industry, it is necessary to pay special attention to the development of the infrastructure of tourist territories based on the concept of sustainable construction. In addition to the concept of sustainable construction that takes into account environmental, social and economic factors of investment and construction projects implementation, it is also proposed to use the cluster approach for the development of tourist territories. Being an example of an investment and construction megaproject, the tourism cluster has a number of specific features, such as complex management, risks of exceeding the estimated cost and failure to meet the deadlines for the implementation, which shall also be taken into account when developing the concept of tourism clusters. The article proposes an algorithm for developing the concept of a tourism cluster that provides for value innovation. Value innovation is an important element in ensuring the competitiveness of the tourism cluster and is closely linked to technical innovations in construction. The proposed algorithm takes into account domestic and foreign experience in the field of sustainable construction, existing certification systems for green, sustainable buildings, as well as the life cycle cost (LCC) estimate.

This increment in urban population causes changes in personal relationships and in the physical structure of cities. Among the transformations caused by metropolization, the most noteworthy are the changes in urban mobility systems. In emerging countries, the problems generated by this situation are exacerbated, since the social, environmental and, mainly, economic characteristics make the solution of problems related to urban transportation very difficult. As consequences, it is common to have daily commutes happening mostly by road transport, absence of effective public policies and poor transport data acquisition. Common ways to achieve quality in public transportation systems are to estimate the public transport occupancy (PTO) rate and the origin-destination matrix for a given area. This paper presents a formulation and study for the use of a low cost and reduced computational complexity system, capable of counting in real time the amount of passengers inside a public transportation unit (bus or metro composition). This system performs passenger counting through users' smartphones electronic fingerprints and uses a mathematical model to adjust the acquired raw values. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated through case studies carried out in 3 different bus lines in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as an alternative to collect field data for the management of public transportation.

The AFC system is usually an entry-only system that only records the serial number of the smart card and the transaction time of each use. Neither the AFC data nor the bus global positioning system (GPS) could reveal the passenger's alighting information, namely, alighting time and station. Hence, the station-to-station origin-destination (OD) trip information cannot be obtained directly from the available data sources. To address this problem, this paper proposes a methodology that estimates the OD matrix by using smart card and GPS data. In this paper, the characteristics of the basic data sources are first analyzed, based on which the bus arrival time is generated using the density-based clustering algorithm and a time correction strategy, based on which the passenger's boarding station is identified. The alighting stations are inferred based on the characteristics of bus trip chaining, which could identify over 80% of the alighting stations on average. Finally, the proposed methodology is verified by a comprehensive field survey in Suzhou, China, with 100% sample rate. © 2020 Di Huang et al.",", Bus transportation; Buses; Clustering algorithms; Global positioning system; Smart cards; Automated fare collection; Density-based clustering algorithms; Field surveys; Multisource data; Origin destination; Time correction; Transaction time; Transit systems; Matrix algebra",English,Article,187,4,Mobility and Transportation
16319641700,"Land Use Change Along Lebih Coastal Line, Entailing Its Designation as A Zone for Tourist Development",2019,"The coastal area is a physically productive area, but is easily degraded which may be due to the lack of planning or even natural factors. The coastal area in Gianyar has experienced a drastic physical development, especially after it is declared as Lebih Tourist Zone or Lebih Tourist Zone (LTZ) and the construction of the arterial road between Tohpati and Kusamba. The study documented in this paper discusses: (i) the form in which the coastal area in Gianyar are utilized post the recognition as the LTZ; (ii) the factors that influence the changes in land utilization in this region; and (iii) how does this condition affect the sustainability of the LTZ. Fundamentally, this study applies the conception of sustainable development and the descriptive qualitative research method. The data were collected through field surveys and in-depth interviews with the land owners, land users, and the authority. The research results showed that the LTZ has experienced a significant change, both physically and non-physically. The factors that influence this change in function is the physical condition of the land, economy, institutional factors, and accessibility. This change has implications for the environment, economy and social culture. This study concludes to develop the sustainability of the LTZ some fundamental actions must be made, namely: evaluate the usage of land, establish clear and restricting zoning law to anticipate any land use violation; consistency in the layout plan; the active participation in the control of land use by the government, the people and private sectors; providing incentives and disincentives in utilizing the space. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Coastal zones; Economics; Smart city; Surveys; Sustainable development; Zoning; change; In-depth interviews; Institutional factors; Land utilization; Physical conditions; Physical development; Qualitative research methods; Research results; Land use, change; land use; sustainability of Lebih Tourist Zone (LTZ)",English,Conference paper,264,3,Urban Sustainability
57190273951; 57295429800,Extending public transit accessibility models to recognise transfer location,2020,"A longstanding issue for public transit agencies has been how to assess the performance of transit service including spatial service coverage to meet the transport needs of the community. The conventional approach quantifies accessibility using door-to-door travel time in such a way that accessibility declines as the travel time to the opportunity increases. A new approach to modelling transit accessibility is proposed by incorporating the potential effect of transfer location. It builds on the premise that transit users may have a preference for a transfer location best located relative to the trip origin and destination points. The model is tested in Brisbane's bus network which has a radial form, where inner-city suburbs have relatively higher accessibility than outer-city suburbs, if only travel time is counted. Incorporating the transfer location refines the accessibility modelling so that some outer-city suburbs located along the major bus corridors have a relatively higher accessibility level. The new model also suggests that inner-city suburbs do not necessarily have better accessibility. Suburbs close to the city centre may have shorter transit travel time to reach other suburbs, but they do not have a well-connected transit network to other suburbs through service transfers. © 2019","Accessibility; GIS; Smart card; Spatial; Transfer; Transit, Australia; Brisbane; Queensland; accessibility; GIS; public transport; spatiotemporal analysis; transportation development; transportation mode; travel time",English,Article,197,4,Mobility and Transportation
57218391664,The geopolitics of Israel’s border question,2020,"A nation at war with its neighbors must seek every possible strategic and tactical advantage. Even in this age of long-range missiles and space weaponry, and of high technology communications and intelligence-gathering gear, control of particular pieces of territory can prove decisive both militarily and politically. When a nation is at peace with its neighbors, the tactical and strategic character of its borders has no military consequences. Of course, command of unique land and water areas may provide economic advantage to one side, and help it to regulate its affairs and enforce its laws more easily. But control of a few square meters or even kilometers of territory is hardly a matter of national survival. Israel, however, is a nation whose continuing state of belligerency with its neighbors has been punctuated by seven wars. In its pursuit of peace, it faces a difficult dilemma with respect to the question of territory and borders. It must be open and forthcoming in negotiations, particularly with respect to the territory that it would be prepared to return in exchange for a formal peace agreement. However, in such negotiations, it must also seek the maximum territorial advantage that diplomacy can gain, as protection against possible future repudiation of such an agreement. But how much territory? Which particular portions? What special legal territorial arrangements? These are questions that should emerge in a serious public debate about the wisdom of entering into negotiations, and would become the essence of the negotiations themselves. Insisting upon holding on to too much of the territories gained in 1967 could undermine the prospects for a successful peace agreement. Retaining too little of the land that was acquired could endanger future generations should a peace agreement prove ephemeral. In this volume, the complexities of the territorial imperative are addressed. The definition of secure borders for Israel is a geopolitical topic. Geopolitics involves complex and interrelated elements in the relationship of peoples to their environments - military, economic, social, political and psychological. These need to be known and understood by both the Israeli and the Palestinian Arab publics, should conditions in the international arena and the Arab camp create either pressures or opportunities for Israel to negotiate a peace based upon United Nations Resolution 242. In recent history, there are few parallels to the Arab-Israeli conflict: it revolves around mutual challenge both to national sovereignty and to territorial boundaries. Israel’s willingness to engage in territorial compromise does not guarantee Arab agreement on the sovereignty issue, but without an expressed willingness, discussions over such an agreement cannot even begin. The Land of Israel has experienced two stages of division, and is now in its third. The first partition, in 1922, separated Transjordan from Western Palestine. The second partition, in 1949, was the product of the armistice agreements between a newly established Israel and surrounding Arab states. In 1967, the third stage of partition was initiated by Israel’s conquest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Sinai and the Golan Heights. Although Sinai and a small part of the Golan were subsequently returned, the political border between Israel and its neighbors will remain in a state of flux until Israel’s territorial security needs and sovereign being are recognized by the Arabs. In exchange, Israel will have to offer the Palestinian Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip a political vehicle for satisfying their desires for self-determination, and to offer Syria a compromise on the Golan. This study addresses possible border adjustments between Israel and a potential Palestinian political entity, and with Syria on the Golan. The factors influencing proposed territorial adjustments once the mutual sovereignty issue is resolved are of both a strategic-tactical and demographic-economic nature. These include defensive depth, surveillance points, marshalling areas and corridors, water control space for Israeli population and industrial growth, absence of dense Arab populations, and psycho-tactical space. The proposed map of territorial compromise requires border adjustments in nine different sectors along the Green Line that once separated Israel from the Jordanian-held West Bank, for a total of 1,165 km2. In the Gaza Strip, 70 km2 are recommended for retention by Israel, and in the Golan Heights, 600 km2. In addition, a lower Jordan Valley Security Zone of 450 km2 is proposed which Israel would hold on a long-term lease, for military and settlement purposes. Three multi-national corridors are also contemplated - Wadi Faria, Jericho-Jerusalem and Med-Dead/Hebron. They cover 200 km2 in Judea and Samaria, and 250 km2 in the northern Negev. These would be corridors of assimilation to promote interaction between Israel, the Arab West Bank and Jordan. They would be customs-free demilitarized zones, and are intended for uses such as regional interconnection, transportation, industry, tourism and recreation, water storage, warehousing and marketing. All told, the suggested territories to be annexed by Israel represent twenty percent of Judea and Samaria, nineteen percent of the Gaza Strip, and half of the Golan Heights. The lower Jordan Valley Security Zone, and the two corridors traversing Judea and Samaria represent another twelve percent of those territories. These territorial adjustments are related, in part, to the geographical expansion needs of the Israeli core area. With the growth of population into the twenty-first century, Israel’s ecumene, or population and economic core, is likely to be extended from its present central coastal plain location northward beyond Haifa, southward to Beersheba and thence to the Gaza Strip-North Sinai borders, and eastward through the Jerusalem corridor to Jerusalem. Optimally, expansion of the ecumene also requires lands on the western flanks of Samaria and Judea. Nations have solved their territorial disputes through partition. In many cases this has led to a lasting peace. In other cases, the partition itself has become a simmering dispute. For Israel, territorial compromise presents many pitfalls, but if it can pave the way to peace, it is a rational choice given the lack of alternatives. © 1986 Taylor & Francis.",,English,Book,979,3,Urban Sustainability

These processes are confronted by several challenges based on behavioural patterns related to human agency. This paper conceptualizes collective regional policy-making processes in a behavioural perspective. It argues that concepts known from behavioural economics can contribute to our understanding of the agency-related challenges in collective regional policy-making processes, and that mitigating the role of human agency can help overcome these behavioural challenges. Case studies from three Austrian provinces show how major challenges to collective policy-making processes can be explained behaviourally, and how these challenges can be countered by mitigating strategies that employ expertise, moderation, indirect participation, delegation of prioritization and evidence. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

On one hand, relying on SAV fleets can provide several operational benefits. On the other hand, SAVs can increase travel distance and add congestion due to unoccupied trips such as pickup and repositioning trips. One important aspect for a SAV fleet's success is to serve the incoming requests at reasonably low waiting time. This is achieved by an adequate fleet size that is spatially distributed thoughtfully so that incoming requests can be served by a nearby vehicle. Unfortunately, it is challenging to keep a satisfactory spatial distribution of vehicles due to imbalances in the origin and destination patterns of incoming requests. This paper focuses on the impact of SAV relocation on traveler wait times using a novel optimization-based algorithm for repositioning. POLARIS, an agent-based tool, is used for a case study of Bloomington, Illinois to quantify the benefits of allowing SAV repositioning. On average, the wait times were around 20% lower with repositioning for all adequate fleet sizes. SAVs were available more uniformly across the region's zones, and proportional to trip-making at different times of day. In addition, enabling repositioning led to a higher share of demands being served. These benefits, however, are achieved at the expense of 6% added vehicles miles traveled. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

7005023697; 7003820247; 57209586766,Anticipating long-distance travel shifts due to self-driving vehicles,2020,"Increasing population and travel demand has prompted new efforts to model travel demand across the United States. One such model is rJourney that estimates travel demand among thousands of regions and models mode and destination choice. rJourney includes records representing 1.17 billion long-distance trips throughout the year 2010. Although inter-regional impacts caused by an increase of automated vehicles (AVs) has been investigated, there is little research on inter-regional travel and how longer distance destination and mode choices will change. Because of conveniences offered by AVs, the value of travel time of drivers is expected to fall, thus reducing the generalized cost of AV travel. To initially analyze the impacts of AVs in the United States, a new AV mode was added to a subset of the rJourney mode and destination choice models. With an initial scenario assuming an operating cost of AVs that is 118% of traditional cars, two outcomes are observed that are solely based on model results. First, the attractiveness of AVs severely digs into the airline travel market, reducing airline revenues to 53%. Second, the introduction of AVs results in a shift of destination choice, increasing travel in further distances for personal vehicles, but favoring closer distances across all modes, for an overall 6.7% decline in US passenger-miles traveled on existing long-distance trips. While this preliminary research has revealed an initial perspective on how an existing model can support AVs, the increasing availability of data as AVs emerge will refine nationwide long-distance modeling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicle; Long distance; National scale; Travel demand modeling, United States; artificial intelligence; intelligent transportation system; modeling; transport vehicle; travel behavior; travel demand",English,Article,250,4,Mobility and Transportation

Alongside the impacts of climate change, poor tourism diversification represents a threat to the resilience of the territory. Thus, heterogenization of noncoastal tourism products presents an opportunity to strengthen regional resilience to present and future challenges, hence the need to study, comparatively, the complementary preferences of tourists and residents of these regions in order to unveil their willingness to diversify their recreational experience, not only in coastal spaces, but also-and especially-in interior territories with low urban density. Consequently, this strategic option may represent a way of strengthening resilience and sustainability through diversification. In this context, a survey was conducted among 400 beach tourists and 400 residents of a case study-namely, three municipalities of the Algarve region in southern Portugal-in order to analyze their degree of preference for activities besides the sun and beach, such as nature-based and cultural tourism activities, and to probe the enhancement potential of each tourism and recreational activity through the various landscape units considered by experts, stakeholders, and tour operators.

The shift of socioeconomic activity and the settlement system to the sea and ocean coasts forms the prerequisites for changing the national innovation landscape. The paper revolves around coastal cities and agglomerations in western Russia based on how they influence innovation processes. The authors present a typology and emphasize the characteristics of the key coastal cities and agglomerations in European Russia as transformational elements of the innovation space. It is revealed that the tourist, marine, transport and logistics, trade and distribution, and industrial components control the strategic relevance of cities and urban agglomerations in European Russia in the development of Russia’s territorial social system. Their role as a transformational element of the innovation space is not quite obvious, unlike similar agglomerations in foreign countries. Innovation support institutions are just beginning to form; they have appeared in the largest agglomerations in the early 2000s, and over the past few years in remaining cities considered. Currently, it is still difficult to assess the contribution of these institutions to the formation of Russian cities as innovation drivers. The authors offer indicators that demonstrate this important city activity. Based on the scoring method, coastal cities and agglomerations in European Russia have been divided into four groups: generator cities, starting generator cities, cities with the potential to generate innovative processes, and cities with weak potential. It was found that cities launch innovative processes precisely through strategic innovations (support institutions, technological environment, and agent operators). At the same time, not only the largest cities have great opportunities, but also individual regional centers integrated into regional development programs and actively force the transition to the smart city platform. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Russian Federation; agglomeration; coastal zone; innovation; socioeconomic impact; typology; urban development; urban economy; urban region, cities; coastal agglomerations; European Russia; innovation generator; innovation process; innovations",English,Article,292,11,Rural Resource Management

The Strawberry Farm had been a top tourist destination not only for its known strawberry picking but also for the nice attraction of the strawberry plants. Needless to say, higher production and better quality of strawberries are of primary concern of the municipality. Strawberries are sensitive to the water content of the soil; hence, soil moisture monitoring is necessary to achieve timely watering. Automatic irrigations use sensors to measure soil moisture. The sensor sends the signal to activate the water valve based on soil moisture content. However, rain may occur right after watering takes place, thus, possible over-moisture of the soil may happen. Prediction of occurrence of rainfall may be necessary in order to postpone the watering of plants which in turn can further reduce the consumption of water. More importantly, available water can be reserved for other purposes. This study uses weather data in predicting rainfall to augment the soil moisture data. This will further enhance the watering schedule of the strawberry farm. ANN was used to relate the various weather parameters in the prediction of occurrence of rainfall. Training accuracy is 95% whereas when validated using the testing data, the accuracy of the model is 80%. The system promotes efficient use of water without compromising strawberry quality and production. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Network; irrigation controller; smart irrigation; soil moisture sensor; weather-based irrigation, Environmental management; Forecasting; Fruits; Irrigation; Nanotechnology; Rain; Soil moisture; Water content; Automatic irrigation; Efficient use of water; Irrigation controllers; Soil moisture monitoring; Strawberry plants; Tourist destinations; Training accuracy; Weather parameters; Moisture control",English,Conference paper,229,3,Urban Sustainability

Cultural tourism, according to theWorld Tourism Organization (UNWTO), is an important and consolidated tourism sector and its strong growth is expected to continue over the coming years. Tourism, the much dreamt of redeemer for historic centres, also represents one of the main threats to heritage conservation: visitors can dynamize an economy, yet the rapid growth of tourism often has negative effects on both built heritage and the lives of local inhabitants. Knowledge of occupancy levels and flows of visiting tourists is key to the efficient management of tourism; the new technologies-the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and geographic information systems (GIS)-when combined in interconnected networks represent a qualitative leap forward, compared to traditional methods of estimating locations and flows. A methodology is described in this paper for the management of tourism flows that is designed to promote sustainable tourism in historic centres through intelligent support mechanisms. As part of the Smart Heritage City (SHCITY) project, a collection system for visitors is developed. Following data collection via monitoring equipment, the analysis of a set of quantitative indicators yields information that can then be used to analyse visitor flows; enabling city managers to make management decisions when the tourism-carrying capacity is exceeded and gives way to overtourism. © 2019 by the authors.","Carrying capacity; Historic centres; Smart heritage city; Smart tourism management; Sustainable cultural tourism; Urban 3-D model, cultural heritage; ecotourism; heritage tourism; historical geography; three-dimensional modeling; tourism development; tourist attraction",English,Article,230,3,Urban Sustainability

51461712000; 35612535300,Optimal design of promotion based demand management strategies in urban rail systems,2019,"Travel demand management (TDM) is used for managing congestion in urban areas. While TDM is well studied for car traffic, its application in transit is still emerging. Well-structured transit TDM approaches can help agencies better manage the available system capacity when the opportunity and investment to expand are limited. However, transit systems are complex and the design of a TDM scheme, deciding when, where, and how much discount or surcharge is implemented, is not trivial. The paper proposes a general framework for the optimal design of promotion based TDM strategies in urban rail systems. The framework consists of two major components: network performance and optimization. The network performance model updates the origin-destination (OD) demand based on the response to the promotion strategy, assigns it to the network, and estimates performance metrics. The optimization model allocates resources to maximize promotion performance in a cost effective way by better targeting users whose behavioral response to the promotion improves system performance. The optimal design of promotion strategies is facilitated by the availability of smart card (automated fare collection, AFC) data. The proposed approach is demonstrated with data from a busy urban rail system. The results illustrate the value of the method, compare the effectiveness of different strategies, and highlight the limits of the effectiveness of such strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Availability; Cost effectiveness; Electric load management; Network performance; Optimal systems; Railroad transportation; Smart cards; Automated fare collection; Behavioral response; Demand management strategies; Optimization modeling; Performance metrics; Promotion strategies; Rail systems; Travel demand management; demand analysis; design; infrastructural development; management practice; optimization; performance assessment; railway transport; strategic approach; traffic congestion; transportation planning; travel demand; urban transport; Information management, Demand management; Optimal promotion design; Smart card data; Urban rail systems",English,Article,218,4,Mobility and Transportation

Similar to roadway transportation, the delays at rail transit systems can also be categorized as non-recurrent and recurrent. This study focuses on the latter in order to reveal delay patterns and knock-on effects occurring on the transit network. For this purpose, we utilize crowdsourced data for the analysis of the recurrent delays occurring at Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) commuter rail system in the State of New York. We conduct an exploratory analysis of the real time transit information app onTime data and calculate delay estimates for different origin-destination (OD) rail service lines and individual stations. The data consists of real-time estimated delays to the stops, based on the difference between the scheduled arrival time and the actual position of the app user. The results indicate that there are distinct differences between delay patterns based on stations proximity to bottleneck stations and the priorities of individual OD lines on the overall transit network. Moreover, findings imply that transportation authority might be adjusting right of way of routes systematically at bottleneck locations to balance and compensate with the accumulated delays. © 2019 IEEE.","Bus transportation; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Light rail transit; Railroad transportation; Transportation routes; Accumulated delay; Bottleneck location; Different origins; Exploratory analysis; Pattern identification; Public transportation; Reliability and safeties; Transit delays; Crowdsourcing, Crowdsourcing; Delay pattern identification; Transit delays",English,Conference paper,208,4,Mobility and Transportation

An expanding tourism sector in Krabi is increasing energy demand, which continues to grow year after year. Meanwhile, the energy supply of the province relies on the centralization of the southern and central regional energy system to the national grid transmission system. According to the 2018 National Power Development Plan, Krabi is projected to shift to regional grid decentralization; coupled with increasing its power generation from renewable energy with affordability and community participation. Therefore, Krabi Vision 2020, which is a provincial master plan, would lead the direction of Krabi's plan towards energy transition. Increasing renewable energy investment and disruptive technology to secure the potential of solar, biomass, biogas, wind and mini-hydro is paving the way to shift Krabi to a sustainable energy future. The implementation of a sustainable energy transition across the province, would bring benefits for the local economy, environmental conservation, and energy security.

Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a sample of inbound visitors (n=205) from Hong Kong as an empirical questionnaire-based survey on visitors’ perceptions of these smart city attributes, which are collected from literature, and framed in Cohen’s Smart City Wheel. Findings: This paper identifies the distinctive factors for branding Hong Kong as a smart city. The results from the factor analysis identify four factors for determining what a smart city is from the perspective of visitors, namely, the quality of a smart society: energy consumption in an urban environment, smart city governance and smart city livelihood. The first two factors further become the determinants of a successful smart city brand considered by visitors, which contribute to their locational decisions and thus the strategies and policies of smart destination branding. Research limitations/implications: The results obtained can serve as insights for tourism policy makers and destination marketers when considering significant information and communication technology, or other smart and sustainable attributes for city branding (e.g. Buhalis and Amaranggana, 2014; Marine-Roig and Anton Clavé, 2015), as well as common investment and resource allocation for shared benefits in similar metropolises. Practical implications: The smartness factors represent important dimensions of urban smartness as prioritized areas for further development, innovation and marketing of tourism industries and enterprises in Hong Kong, as a mature urban destination incorporating the branding of a proposed smart district as a strategy of urban development. Originality/value: Smart urban development and tourism development have increasingly become inseparable, especially when visitors utilize cities as tourist destinations but share other urban resources and spaces with local citizens. Unlike the development of smart tourist attractions, smart tourist destinations should have a wider scope of smartness. A smart tourist destination may carry similar and overlapping characteristics of smart cities, which may be interpreted by visitors and may eventually affect their perceived image of a city. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.",", City branding; Hong Kong; Smart city; Smart tourism; Smart tourist destination",English,Article,349,3,Urban Sustainability

Therefore, this paper measured and compared characteristics of drivable street networks (DSNs) and walkable street networks (WSNs) of the 26 ASCN pilot cities by applying multiple network metrics. The OSMnx tool was used to download and analyse WSNs and DSNs from the OpenStreetMap. The findings present the topological and geometric characteristics of WSNs and DSNs that are diverse and characterized by different factors. The cities with orthogonal street grids, high street density, intersection density, and fewer cul-de-sacs have good accessibility to reach destinations. In contrast, some other cities have more curvilinear and circuitous SNs with many missing links to other streets, which in turn are prone to traffic disruption. The study highlights the important features of SNs that have significant implications for future designs of SNs in the ASCN whose goal is to make cities smart and liveable for ASEAN members. © 2019 by the authors.",", OpenStreetMap; OSMnx; Smart city; Street network analysis; Urban morphology",English,Article,203,3,Urban Sustainability

57193529049; 57209588371,Why al-shabaab attacks Kenya: Questioning the narrative paradigm,2019,"This article questions the current narrative paradigm and argues that al-Shabaab attacks Kenya for strategic and highly rational reasons, beyond sharing a border and having bases in southern Somalia closer to major population centres than Ethiopia or Uganda. Al-Shabaab targets Kenya more than other frontline states because of the opportunity spaces linked to Kenya’s international status and visibility, its relatively free and independent media that widely publicizes terrorist attacks, a highly developed and lucrative tourist sector that provides soft targets, the comparatively high number of Kenyan foreign fighters within the group’s ranks, the presence of terror cells in Kenya, expanding democratic space, and high levels of corruption. These variables play into al-Shabaab’s motivations and aid planning and execution of terrorist acts that aim to fulfil the group’s quest to survive by maintaining relevance. In order to address this predictable menace, we offer a number of measures that Kenya needs to take, including reducing corruption in order to properly invest in intelligence efforts and relevant homeland security measures, thereby making it possible for Kenya to sustainably and effectively combat al-Shabaab. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",", Al-Shabaab; Armed non-state actors; Counterterrorism; East Africa; Horn of Africa; Kenya; Somalia; Strategy; Tactics; Terrorism",English,Article,184,3,Urban Sustainability

Nevertheless, the environmental crisis should not be seen as an isolated phenomenon amid contemporary capitalism. On the contrary, a very distinct feature of the current wave of land grabs is the convergence of multiple crises, including food, energy/fuel, environmental, and financial. The Southern Mozambique District, Massingir, is an area with high potential regarding water sources and biodiversity. It recently became a host of a biofuel project, and also a huge block of land is being transformed into a conservation/tourism area; answering to many issues within capitalism's crisis, this area is an evidence of how synergetic resource grabbing can arise as a response to the convergence of multiple crises. Therefore, by analyzing the emerging politics of natural resources in Massingir District and the dynamics regarding the land-use change, changes in property relations, it is possible to understand how rural livelihoods are shaped. Risks related to food security and sovereignty, loss of control and access to resources, consistent narrowing down of the set of livelihood strategies, and inter-community conflicts over scarce resources are the main implications of such emerging climate-smart land politics. © 2019 by the authors.",", Biofuel; Climate change; Conservation; Land grabbing; Rural livelihoods",English,Article,209,11,Rural Resource Management

With the increasing population, it has produced adverse effects like rapid consumption of fuel resources, high carbon emissions, and global traffic issue. In such cases, vehicle sharing is gaining attraction as a possible candidate solution. We have implemented a vehicle sharing rider matching model which matches users reaching nearby destinations. The algorithm then undergoes another matching layer, which filters users based on user characteristics. Best-matched users are then added to a final itinerary forming the route for the commute. In our model, we have used New York City cab zone locations with real-Time navigation using Google Maps. We have introduced the concept of 'User Threshold Time (UTT),' the time riders are willing to spend to pick other riders. Our major motive is to complete the pool for the maximum number of trips based on user characteristics. On a global scale, our model aims at saving resources and improve overall global atmospheric conditions. Results show that our matching model can be achievable in a reasonable time constraint. © 2019 IEEE.","Internet of things; Smart city; carpooling; characteristics; Ride-sharing; User feedback; user threshold time; Vehicles, carpooling; characteristics; ride-sharing; user feedback system; user threshold time; vehicle sharing",English,Conference paper,177,4,Mobility and Transportation

The historical development of the modifications of navigable sections of the Elbe and the Vltava Rivers documents that its beginnings coincide with the beginnings of the settlement of the river valleys in the Middle Ages. These modifications were related to the human need to use rivers for navigation and hydropower generation and went through an interesting development throughout the Medieval Times. The lock structures situated on the Elbe-Vltava Waterway represent extensive and unique technical heritage which still serves its original purpose. The locks are typically composed of a weir structure, a lock and a hydroelectric power plant. The project's objective is to document the existing technical heritage at the level of individual locks and their construction and technological elements. Furthermore, attention will be focused on the identification of endangered structures on the Elbe-Vltava waterway which no longer meet the present-day functional or capacity requirements and which will probably need to undergo sensitive modernisations in the future in the context of their cultural and historical value. The project intends to present and introduce these technical monuments to the general public. The presentation of the structures includes the historical development of their design, the description of the original technological elements and their present-day role in water transport, and the exploitation of their potential for recreation and tourism. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",", Hydroelectric power plants; Intelligent buildings; Locks (fasteners); Rivers; Sustainable development; Capacity requirement; Cultural heritages; Cultural identity; General publics; Historical development; Hydro-power generation; Technical heritage; Water transport; Hydroelectric power",English,Conference paper,266,3,Urban Sustainability

Thus, via a case study of Sardinia island (Italy), this study analyses regional transport data to evaluate the interrelations and mobility issues between the main cities and the settlement geographies of internal areas with a predominantly agricultural vocation. First, it frames the problems (common to the islands) theoretically and focuses on how the internal areas (considered marginal for a long time) have considerable material and immaterial resources to be valorised. Second, the study evaluates the internal relationship networks that characterise the island territory through the cluster and principal components analysis using origin-destination data to represent vocations and population needs. A smart governance strategy is proposed for Sardinia through an assessment of the functionality of urban settlements and interconnections between the hinterlands (the small and the main cities of the case study), following the smart region paradigm. The study underlines the importance of the interconnection between urban geographical areas. Thus, given an analytical-numerical approach, the originality of this research is highlighted in how it is possible to extract social vocations of the territory, which is generally not easily quantifiable. © 2019 by the authors.","Italy; Sardinia; economic impact; governance approach; planning method; principal component analysis; regional planning; resettlement policy; social impact; social mobility; strategic approach; tourist destination; urban geography; urban planning, Mobility; Origin-destination analysis; Sardinia; Smart governance strategy; Smart island; Smart region",English,Article,205,3,Urban Sustainability

However, as renewable energy development often changes the visual appearance of landscapes and might affect other industries relying on them, such as nature-based tourism, it therefore requires careful planning. This is especially true in Iceland, a country rich in renewable energy resources and a popular nature-based tourism destination. The present study investigated the potential impacts on tourism of the proposed Hverfisfljót hydropower plant by identifying the main attractions of the area as well as by analyzing visitors' perceptions, preferences and attitudes, and the place meanings they assign to the landscape of the area. The data for the study were collected using onsite questionnaire surveys, interviews with visitors to the area, open-ended diaries, and participant observation. The results reveal that the area of the proposed power plant is perceived as wilderness by its visitors, who seek environmental settings related to the components of a wilderness experience. Visitors were highly satisfied with the present settings and preferred to protect the area from development to ensure the provision of currently available recreational opportunities. The results further show that the proposed Hverfisfljót hydropower plant would reduce the attractiveness of the area to its visitors, degrade their wilderness experience, and therefore strongly reduce their interest in visiting the area. Moreover, the participants perceived the already developed lowlands of the country as more suitable for renewable energy development than the undeveloped highland areas, which is in line with the principles of smart practices for renewable energy development. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy infrastructure; Nature-based tourism; Renewable energy; Visitor; Visual impacts; Wilderness, Iceland; alternative energy; carbon sequestration; climate change; nuclear power plant; perception; power plant; questionnaire survey; resource development",English,Article,264,11,Rural Resource Management
36835588100; 16232025000,The concept of comprehensive tracking software to support sustainable tourism in protected areas,2019,"Visitor management in protected areas requires knowledge of visitors-their numbers, time-space curves, motivation, behavior, and satisfaction as an important input. The systematic analysis, comparison, and synthesis of visitor monitoring methods, with the focus on methods for individual tracking, is conceptualized in the form of a mind map. The map serves as a basis for managed dialogues with experts from several protected areas in the Czech Republic. The theory and experts' practical insight are processed by the means of systems analysis with the aim to formulate (1) a guideline for the integration of heterogeneous data about visitors and (2) the concept of an advanced intelligent software tour guide with an individual tracking function. The proposed concept aims to achieve comprehensive monitoring of visitors' time-space behavior in the context of their socio-demographics, goals, preferences, feelings, and the resulting impressions. In addition, the visitor flows may be interactively influenced in a personalized way by the application, leading to better individual impressions and satisfaction, with full respect for the carrying capacity of the territory. Related challenges, such as the stimulation of visitors to use the application, are discussed. The ongoing experimental implementation of the concept as a part of a comprehensive destination application is mentioned at the end. © 2019 by the authors.","Carrying capacity; Intelligent software; Monitoring; Protected areas; Visitors management, carrying capacity; ecotourism; environmental management; integrated approach; protected area; software",English,Article,209,3,Urban Sustainability

This problem arises in large urban rail networks with multiple lines that the passengers may transfer among different lines to arrive at their destinations. We propose an exact formulation to generate the optimal train timetables of all the involved lines in a rail transit network synchronously, and our objective is to minimize the maximal level of crowdedness of stations. In particular, we introduce several sets of passenger flow variables that enable to model this complex problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) that is possible to be solved to the optimal solution. By considering the number of boarding and alighting passengers as passenger flow variables, we explicitly incorporates the number of in-vehicle passengers in the modelling framework to capture the train carrying capacity constraints. The formulated models first extend the passenger-oriented train timetabling models in existing literature from a single transit line to a whole connected network.

Carsharing is a growing industry and some players are trying to get a hold in the already competitive market. The current transportation market offers consumers many options for buying a vehicle, but fewer practical options for using a vehicle occasionally. Carsharing provides the benefits of allowing easy access to vehicles spread across the city that are rented per an hour or day. It is an increasingly common option for locals and tourists who want to get from one place to another without spending too much time on public transports. These have the added benefit of convenience and comfort of four-wheelers without paying much extra, as in the case of conventional rental cars, taxi, or cabs. This paper uses Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM) to evaluate the factors influencing the selection of the best carsharing alternative around Portland area by analyzing different perspectives and criteria that influence the selection. This paper address which criteria are most important to renters and provide recommendations for renters and carsharing businesses. The findings suggest that most essential criteria for the consumers are insurance coverage, reliability, rental cost, drop-off-options, and gas cost. © 2019 PICMET.",", Insurance; Intelligent systems; Taxicabs; Business modeling; Competitive markets; Hierarchical decision models; Insurance coverages; Private vehicles; Public transport; Short periods; Transportation markets; Commerce",English,Conference paper,219,4,Mobility and Transportation

This study analyses whether and how regional systems of innovation influence the competiveness of tourism destinations in Europe. Impacts of both traditional production factors (physical and human capital), productivity, specialization and other contextual variables–related to the territorial capital of each region–on regional tourism performance of 237 European regions (NUTS 2) are analysed over a period of 8 years, using advanced techniques for spatial econometric analysis. The results reveal lower levels of productivity in those regions where tourism services are more labour intensive, while regions where education, innovation and productivity demonstrate higher levels are those where gross value added in tourism is less important for the regional economy. Policy implications are discussed, taking into consideration the principles for smart specialisation strategies in European regions and the possibility for cross-border regional cooperation.

Key to understanding how to posit new transit opportunities requires a granular understanding of origin-destination travel demand. By using Mobiliti, a HPC simulation developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that populates origins and destinations and simulates their use of the transportation network, that granular understanding can be achieved. This data can be used to understand how current and potential future transit routes serve regional demand and how those services can be improved, an increasingly important aspiration in the face of falling transit ridership, increasing congestion, and environmental concerns. To understand how existing transit routes serve the demand, an origin and destination falling within a quarter mile around bus and light rail routes were considered zero-transfer transit-feasible; the results of this rudimentary analysis were noteworthy, with simulated feasible ridership up to five times higher than actual ridership seen by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. Using OpenTripPlanner, we found the average transit trip time to be approximately three times the driving time for that set of transit-feasible trips. This points to a need to increase the operational efficiency of transit services that cannot compete with auto traffic. The second portion of the analysis focuses on understanding how the transit network can be changed to better accommodate the demand. By understanding the origin-destination pairs unserved by the current transit network, corridors of high demand can be visualized, identified. Public transit is key to cities, and this methodology uses novel data sources to inform the design and development of that oft-overlooked workhorse of urban mobility. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Metropolitan area networks; Rapid transit; Smart city; Transportation routes; Design and Development; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Metropolitan scale simulation; Mode shifts; Operational efficiencies; Origin and destinations; Origin-destination pairs; Transit; Light rail transit, Metropolitan scale simulation; Mode shift; Transit",English,Conference paper,273,4,Mobility and Transportation

Main drivers are the construction of hydropower dams on the Vu Gia and Thu Bon Rivers, illegal sand mining in the South China Sea, and sea level rise along the Central Coast Vietnam. Coastal erosion affects the tourism attraction of this area. A challenge for both the national government and the local authorities is understanding the nature of the contemporary coastal erosion; this includes the beach erosion and tourism relationship. This study deals with the damage valuation of the beach erosion in relation to the tourism revenue based on the hedonic pricing method. Cua Dai beach of Hoi An is structured into 23 beach sectors along the shore, each of which shows a relative homogeny in physical characteristics, anthropogenic activities, and socioeconomics. The beach value is function of morphological variables such as beach width and distance to the city center, and tourism variables such as tourist area, coastal businesses, the number of hotels, and the number of hotel rooms. The two-stage least squares (2SLS) of the custom-log model is the most accurate approach. The total projected revenue losses are more than an estimated 29 million US dollars by 2040. The present values of the total annual revenue losses in 2020, 2030, and 2040 are about 29.6, 21.4, and 14 million US dollars, respectively, at an interest rate of 5%. The results suggest mitigation strategies and policy recommendations. The proposal includes improving the adaptation capacity to coastal erosion using innovative, smart, and wise solutions.

One of the most demanded approaches by the new hyper-connected visitors is the expectation of plunging and becoming a short-term resident to receive a real experience during their visit. Therefore, the scope of this research covers the objective of designing an innovative communication channel between a visitor and a point of interest (POI), which in turn allows agile experiences to be built and provided and increases the dissemination of cultural heritage through new technologies, considering the real needs of the territories and the new digital visitors. In order to address these topics, this paper proposes an innovative and co-created progressiveWeb-App for visitors called Be Memories in order to spread the intangible heritage of a tourist destination, where the content is co-created by residents of the destination. The tool has been tested in Ceutí, a Spanish village with a high cultural value, which needs to be disseminated through new innovative tools. The trial was launched during local festivities of the village using an Internet of Things device, called a Smart Spot, to establish a communication channel between the visitor and POI. The results of the test were measured using Google Analytics, the reactions of Be Memories in social networks, and the acceptance of other cities and European committees. The results have concluded that Be Memories is able to enable a local experience via agile, fresh, and crowd-sourced content that people enjoy. This channel presents a complementary level of information with respect to official sources, documentaries, and local guide tours, at the same time enabling a mechanism to promote physical visits, walking tours, and cultural heritage via low-cost and sustainable infrastructure. © 2019 by the authors.","Co-creation; Hyper-connected users; ICTs; Internet of Things (IoT); Point of interest; Prosumers; Residents; Smart tourism destination; Sustainability; Tourist guides, cultural heritage; ecotourism; information and communication technology; Internet; sustainability; territory; testing method; tourist destination",English,Article,308,3,Urban Sustainability
6701342037,Stop bashing the suburbs: Mobility limitations of older residents are less relevant as connectivity options expand,2019,"Most older persons (age 65 and over) in the United States occupy suburban residential areas. Distinguishing where the older population lives is important because critics argue that the built environments of their suburban communities make it difficult for them to age in place successfully, that is, to have healthy, independent, active, and enjoyable lives. They point to their low population and building densities, long distances separating their residences from services, amenities, and commercial areas, and few transit and walking options. Consequently, when the mobility limitations of older residents prevent them from safely driving their vehicles, they have difficulties reaching destinations outside their homes (mobility behaviors) to satisfy their discretionary and obligatory needs. This paper questions this suburban bashing. It argues that future cohorts of older people, especially women, will be more able to drive, cars will be technologically safer and easier to operate, and ride-sharing options will be more available. More suburbs will also have mixed-use and pedestrian-accessible built environments reducing the need for vehicular travel. Most importantly, the information, activities, goods, services, and care required by older people to age in place will be delivered to their dwellings. Home sharing, home care, internet connectivity, e-commerce, social media, smart homes, telemedicine and robotic technologies will make the mobility or out-of-home behaviors of older residents less necessary. The paper introduces the constructs of connectivity options and connectivity behaviors to encompass these expanded travel and in-home delivery strategies. These new ways of connecting with their environments will result in more self-reliant older persons who are less constrained by their mobility limitations.

The key challenge for smart cities and communities is to significantly increase the overall quality of life in urban areas, for the benefit of their inhabitants and economic activities. This process occurs both through the improvement of traditional utility-grids and services, and through the implementation of digital sensor- and communication technologies in the urban ecosystem. In this scenario, the adoption of enabling tools to support the smart urban development, appears crucial to manage processes and data information flows, as well as to permit better communication and collaboration among the involved stakeholders. This paper describes the development methodology of an open digital platform for smart cities. This platform will be an enabling tool for the smart urban development of a city i.e. will be able to support and encourage the growth of new services for - and with - citizens, companies, tourists, and public administrations. The concept derives from the ongoing research project OPENIoT4SmartCities, funded by the Operational Programme European Regional Development Fund ERDF 2014-2020 (CUP: B11B17000720008) Südtirol/Alto Adige. The main objective is to realise a product-prototype software, for the management of smart services in cities, using IoT. The platform has been designed based on the specific service needs of Merano, a city in South Tyrol, Italy. The activities regard the identification of concrete use cases in the field of public illumination and water management. In particular, this paper will present the results of previous analysis, consultation meetings and workshops that have been conducted by the research team together with the public administration and local service providers of the city of Merano. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, the rapid growth of Bike sharing systems, particularly, the dockless ones, leads to a series of new problems, such as destructive competition, wasting of resources, discretionary parking, etc. To this end, this paper aims to develop a new type of public transport service, namely, micro-circulation bus, according to spatiotemporal analysis of multimode pick-up and drop-off demands. In particular, we first identify the stations of micro-circulation bus by clustering the large-scale pick-up and drop-off points, then construct transition network according to spatiotemporal Origin-Destination (OD) analysis. Last, an iterative greedy algorithm is proposed to plan the routes of micro-circulation buses by decreasing transportation afford on constructed transition network gradually. Experiments are conducted on real-world data, results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and also reveal the potential of first and last-mile ransportation service by micro-circulation buses. © 2019 IEEE.","Bus transportation; Buses; Drops; Iterative methods; Microcirculation; Pickups; Smart city; Transportation routes; Trusted computing; Ubiquitous computing; Iterative greedy algorithm; Origin destination; Public transport; Public transport service; Sharing systems; Spatiotemporal analysis; Temporal and spatial; Travel demand; Urban transportation, Micro-circulation bus; Public transport; Sharing-economy; Spatiotemporal analysis",English,Conference paper,163,4,Mobility and Transportation

It is a crucial factor for urban railway operations. This study aims to estimate the route traveled by urban railway passengers using smartcard data and train log data. To estimate the traveled route, a route generation algorithm is developed and three route estimation algorithms, i.e., forward algorithm, backward algorithm, and forward and backward (FB) algorithm, are proposed. To evaluate the performance of the developed algorithm, results were compared with results obtained using the multinomial logit (MNL) model and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). For the application of the algorithm, two origin-destination pairs, i.e., Dangsan station to Seoul National University of Education (SNUE) station, and Dogok station to Jungja station are employed in the analysis. The FB algorithm showed the highest accuracy among the algorithms. The accuracy for the Dangsan station to SNUE station and Dogok station to Jungja station routes are estimated to be 88.0% and 90.9%, respectively. The results of this comparison analysis with MNL and GMM show that the FB algorithm had the highest accuracy. © 2019 The Korean Society for Railway.

In such circumstances, it is commonly assumed that passengers may arrive randomly to a stop and may behave according to a “strategy”; such a strategy is associated with a so-called “attractive” set of routes: a passenger selects a set of routes departing from the stop, and will board the next vehicle to depart from among that set of routes. We extend the conventional notion of attractive sets by introducing a measure of “attractiveness” that allows for randomness in the choice of attractive routes. The proposed model uses a link-based (recursive, or sequential choice) formulation, rather than a path-based formulation, which has the advantage of including all path alternatives without the need for path set enumeration. The recursive formulation is also very suitable for smart card data because it allows model calibration with incomplete path choice observations. The link-based approach was originally advocated by Nguyen et al. (1988) in the strategy-based transit assignment context, but without investigating methods for model calibration or empirical analysis. Recently, Fosgerau et al. (2013) and Mai et al. (2015) have presented methods to empirically estimate traffic path choice models using a link-based formulation. Our framework builds off these previous works to formulate and estimate a strategy-based path choice model with smart card data. The proposed model is tested with a 6 months extract from the smart card transactions in Brisbane, Australia, for two popular origin-destination pairs with diverse path alternatives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Brisbane; Queensland; Railroad transportation; Urban transportation; Brisbane , Australia; Empirical analysis; Link-based approach; Origin-destination pairs; Path choice; Public transit; Recursive formulation; Transit assignment; bus transport; modeling; public transport; railway transport; Smart cards, Optimal strategy transit assignment; Public transit path choice; Public transit smart card data; Recursive path choice model",English,Article,259,4,Mobility and Transportation

Customers desire to wait the minimum time before finding a taxi, while drivers aim to maximize their profits by speeding up their customer hunting. In this paper, we propose to exploit the benefits of vehicular social network by enabling data exchange and more cooperation among regular taxi drivers. The objective is to design a smart recommendation sys-tem allowing drivers to optimize three key performance metrics: number of pickups, customer waiting time, and vacant travel distance. The proposed recommendation starts by efficiently estimating the future customer demands in the different region of interest. Then, it proposes an optimal taxi-to-region matching according to the current location of each taxi and the requested demand. Finally, an optimized routing algorithm is proposed to allow taxi drivers reach their destinations faster. Our simulation model is applied on the borough of Manhattan, NYC, and is validated with realistic data. The selected results show that significant performance gains can be achieved as compared to the traditional scenario. © 2019 IEEE.","Demand prediction; Intelligent transportation systems; Smart cities; Taxi recommendation; Vehicle social network, Electronic data interchange; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Sales; Smart city; Taxicabs; Customer demands; Demand prediction; Intelligent transportation systems; Optimized routing; Performance metrics; Region of interest; Simulation model; Taxi recommendation; Fleet operations",English,Conference paper,184,4,Mobility and Transportation

The concept of urban sustainability is evolving, also in relation to the incoming world of ""smart cities,"" and it should be related to a systemic vision of the city. Referring to a systemic approach for the study of urban phenomena, sustainability can be considered as a target condition that cities have to achieve in order to contrast ""urban entropy"" and behave as smart cities. In this regard, our study starts from the premise that entropy is a negative state, which can affect the urban system in all its components. Among these components, the social subsystem can play a strategic role and some urban functions (such as the components of the functional subsystem) can be designated as ""driving functions"" that are able to lead the urban system towards a sustainable and smarter state of equilibrium. This equilibrium, though not static, can provide the efficiency of the system. Since tourism interests several aspects and sectors, it can be considered as one of the forces that, if properly controlled (i.e., by integrating it into the process of evolution of the system), would positively influence the evolution of the urban system. The application of the theoretical framework refers to the social (active) component of tourism, represented by the tourist flows that move inside the physical subsystem and can be traced through the data they disseminate by the use of their personal devices, with the aim of individuating the urban zones where the load of tourism concentrates. These areas can be marked as the ones urban planners and decision-makers have to first monitor in order to control the general state of the urban system equilibrium. © 2019 by the authors.","Systemic approach; Urban entropy; Urban smartness; Urban tourism, entropy; institutional framework; smart city; sustainability; tourism development; tourism market; urban planning",English,Article,305,3,Urban Sustainability

56470632000; 57198233972,Towards demand-oriented flexible rerouting of public transit under uncertainty,2019,"This paper proposes a flexible rerouting strategy for the public transit to accommodate the spatiooral variation in the travel demand. Transit routes are typically static in nature, i.e., the buses serve well-defined routes; this results in people living in away from the bus routes choose alternate transit modes such as private automotive vehicles resulting in ever-increasing traffic congestion. In the flex-transit mode, we reroute the buses to accommodate high travel demand areas away from the static routes considering its spatiooral variation. We perform clustering to identify several flex stops; these are stops not on the static routes, but with high travel demand around them. We divide the bus stops on the static routes into critical and non-critical bus stops; critical bus stops refer to transfer points, where people change bus routes to reach their destinations. In the existing static scheduling process, some slack time is provided at the end of each trip to account for any travel delays. Thus, the additional travel time incurred due to taking flexible routes is constrained to be less than the available slack time. We use the percent increase in travel demand to analyze the effectiveness of the rerouting process. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using real-world travel data for Route 7 operated by the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). © 2019 ACM.","Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Smart city; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Urban transportation; clustering; demand; flexible; Public transit; rerouting; Buses, clustering; demand; flexible; public transit; rerouting",English,Conference paper,218,4,Mobility and Transportation

A way to deal with all problems of cities is the performance of the Smart City conception, which allows to build intelligent solutions improving transport, energy technology, tourism and many other fields that constitute the economy. The basis of the operation should be an efficient communication infrastructure, because the dynamics of the economic development is significantly dependent on the efficiency and the reliability of the communication system. It can be also stated that the development of the transport networks, including those on highly urbanised areas, is essential to ensure proper functioning of economic and social life. Correctly conducted monitoring and the diagnostics of the bridges should help the road administration with managing these objects and with extending the lifetime period, so it should allow to optimise the completion period and the scope of possible renovation, repair or enforcement, and in the case of discovering that there are damages that endanger the safety of the construction, it should ensure justified removal from service. The article presents an example of the use of acoustic emission method for the assessment of the condition of My Thuan cable-stayed bridge by the Tien Giang river. The application of AE technique enables monitoring and following the processes occurring in the total volume of the structure, regardless of stress and deformations, but depending on the integrity of the construction, and this is of key importance for the durability of use and safe work of the bridge.

Recurrent patterns in prevailing demand patterns can be used by service providers to better anticipate future demand distribution and thus support demand-Anticipatory fleet management strategies. To this end, we propose three steps for extracting such demand patterns from travel requests: (1) constructing the origin-destination zones by spatial clustering, (2) composing the hourly and daily origin-destination matrix, and; (3) temporal clustering to extract the dynamic demand patterns. We demonstrate the three step approach on the open-source Didi ride-sourcing data. The data consists of travel requests data for November 2016 from Chengdu, China amounting to approximately 6 million rides. The analysis reveals pronounced and recurrent and thus predictable daily and weekly patterns with distinct spatial properties pertaining to ride-sourcing production and attraction characteristics. © 2019 IEEE.","Fleet operations; Intelligent systems; Taxicabs; Demand pattern; ride-sourcing; Spatial clustering; taxi data; Temporal clustering; Intelligent vehicle highway systems, demand patterns; ride-sourcing; spatial clustering; taxi data; temporal clustering",English,Conference paper,145,4,Mobility and Transportation

In some cases, ferry services are in direct competition with other land-based transport, and despite often longer travel times passengers still choose water transport. This paper seeks to identify a premium attached to urban water transit through an identification of excess travel patterns. A one-month sample of smart card transaction data for Brisbane, Australia, was used to compare bus and ferry origin–destination pairs between a selected suburban location and the central business district. Logistic regression of the data found that ferry travel tended towards longer travel times (OR = 2.282), suggesting passengers do derive positive utility from ferry journeys. The research suggests the further need to incorporate non-traditional measures other than travel time for deciding the value of water transit systems. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Current and foreseen changes connected to human activities, namely land and water uses and potential conflicts, in frame of environmental policies, sustainable economic development and human well-being require the implementation of ecosystem-based management (EBM) planning processes considering the connectivity across marine, transitional, freshwater, and terrestrial domains. The main objective is to elaborate on the co-development of the EBM planning process across the three water domains, all characterized by high biodiversity and by the wide range of services provided by ecosystems and their abiotic components, for the mitigation of impacts from the management plan under implementation. The approach used follows a stepwise procedure in frame of resilience principles, considering the analysis of the relationship between the social and ecological components and on how these can be connected through risk assessment and a spatial multi-criteria analysis based on the delivery of ecosystem services. Stakeholders’ perception matched the ecosystem services provisioning risk assessment and supported the planning EBM response that consist in saltmarshes and seagrasses meadows restoration programs.

55962784400,Against the Grain? Assessing Graduate Labour Market Trends in Germany Through a Task-Based Indicator of Graduate Jobs,2019,"Applying work by Green and Henseke (in IZA J Labor Policy 5(1):14, 2016a), this study examines changes in the German graduate labour market in the twenty-first century. To do so, it deploys a new statistically derived indicator of graduate jobs, based on job skill requirements obtained from worker-reported task data in the German Employment Surveys 2006 and 2012. As in previous work, the resulting classifier explains differences in graduate labour market outcomes better than existing methods and can be applied in a range of contexts where intelligence on graduate destinations is desired. It is supplied in the appendix of this study. Despite the expansion of higher educational attainment between 1999 and 2012, my analysis indicates a rising excess demand for graduate labour. Following key findings emerge: Graduate skills are required beyond the narrow range of professions. Work tasks associated with cognitive skills use are key determinants of higher education requirements on the job.The proportion of graduates in the age bracket 25–34 has risen among men from 14.7 to 18.9% and from 13.3 to 22.5% among women between 1999 and 2012. Young women have become the group with greatest level of higher education in the labour market.The growing supply of graduate labour in the age bracket 25–34 was surpassed by the expansion of employment in graduate jobs. The employment share of graduate jobs shifted by 17 percentage points to almost 30% among young women and by 11 percentage points to 28% among young men.Among young female graduates, the incidence of underemployment fell to 22% between 1999 and 2012; roughly comparable to the level among males at the same ages. Prime aged female graduates, however, experience above average rates of underemployment.A sharp rise of the pay premium associated with higher education among men contrasts with stagnating wage differentials among women.The pay penalty associated with underemployment has not changed statistically significantly. © 2018, The Author(s).","Germany; educational attainment; employment; higher education; labor market; trend analysis; wage, Graduate jobs; Higher education; Underemployment; Wage dispersion; Wages",English,Article,312,11,Rural Resource Management

In an attempt to move away from privately-operated urban developments in the form of newly built smart cities, an alternate framework has been proposed by Allam and Newman to redefine this timely concept for existing cities with the main dimensions being metabolism, culture, and governance. This new framework focuses on liveability and sustainability that builds on the cultural and historical dimensions of existing cities. This study adds to the redefined smart city paradigm by proposing a new pillar in the form of smart tourism for the city of Port Louis, Mauritius. This paper reviews models of smart tourism and explores how this can be grafted to the Allam and Newman’s smart city model.

The effect of fare policies, however, in conjunction with built and non-built environment features has not been assessed. Given the 2017 fare policy change introduced in South East Queensland, Australia, this study examines how the policy reform (changes in fares, its structure and incentives) affects public transport ridership. Drawing on two like-for-like periods of transport smart card data before and after the policy reform, we compare the number of card users, journeys, and travel costs under the two fare systems. Through a set of statistical analysis and spatial lag regression, we examine the impact of the fare policy change on ridership, controlled by variations of built and non-built environment features, including population density, land use diversity, demographic features of commuters, distance to the central business district (CBD) and destination accessibility. Our findings show that public transit ridership can be boosted by reducing the fare cost per journey which can then result in overall revenue gain. However, such attraction by fare reduction varies substantially by user groups. Furthermore, the influences of population density, destination accessibility, distance to CBD and demographic features of commuters on ridership are significant (p < 0.01); while the influences of land use diversity and fare change tend to be insignificant compared to the other D-factors. We argue that in order to increase public transport usage policy makers need to consider fare policy reform in conjunction with built environment and demographic factors in order to increase service availability and ensure that services are accessible and affordable to the general public. This study also offers a generic framework that employs big data analytics to assess public policy intervention in the Australian context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Queensland; commuting; policy reform; public transport; regression analysis; spatial analysis; transportation policy, Built environment; Fare policy change; Public transport; Smart card data; Southern East Queensland; Transit ridership",English,Article,305,4,Mobility and Transportation

Until the implementation of the connected vehicle takes place, it is still necessary to install sensors to obtain information about mobility. Bluetooth sensors are becoming a useful tool due to the low cost of equipment and installation. The use of Bluetooth sensors in cities, with short distances between sensors, makes it necessary to propose new classification algorithms that allow the trips of pedestrians and vehicles to be differentiated. This article presents the study carried out in the city of Valencia to determine the use of motor vehicles in the historic center and propose a new classification algorithm to distinguish between an onboard Bluetooth device and the same device carried by a pedestrian when it is not possible to use the travel time for the classification due to the short distance between sensors. This causes very similar or even indistinguishable travel times for vehicles and for pedestrians. We also propose an algorithm that allows vehicles to be classified according to what type of trip is made always through the historical center of Valencia, whether it is to make a shorter itinerary through the city or to access the center for any type of business. This algorithm would enable the Origin-Destination matrix of an urban network with short distances between sensors if they are available in all entries and exits. Likewise, the results obtained have allowed to positively evaluate the algorithm defined to distinguish between trips made by a pedestrian or a vehicle in a city, using the MAC address of their mobile devices with very short distances among sensors. The results of this study show that it is possible to use Bluetooth technology, with low cost installations, to evaluate the use of the city by motor vehicles. © 2019 by the authors.","Bluetooth sensor; Mobility studies using BT; Origin-Destination matrices; Smart city; Traffic management; Valencia city center; Vehicle and pedestrian travel time, Comunidad Valencia; Spain; algorithm; equipment; installation; sensor; smart city; social mobility; tourist destination; traffic management; transport vehicle; travel time",English,Article,319,4,Mobility and Transportation

Several different types of car-sharing services have been developed such as round-Trip and free-floating: The first one is characterized by a more rigid structure because of its station-based nature, the second tends to be more flexible since a customer can pick up and drop off the car in any public parking inside a wide area. Being a member is the first step users have to take to use this sharing service. This study focuses on the analysis of supply attributes directly linked to territorial characteristics such as parking availability, parking price, distance from the city center, users' trip chain in relation with location of activities and their impact on the membership choice. By using a binary logit model, and a synthetic population of the city of Berlin representing members of both the round-Trip and the free-floating service, and through a sensitivity analysis, the study shows how membership is sensible to some of these attributes identifying which supply characteristics impact the user membership choice. Results suggest there are two typical membership profiles and the attributes that lead the choice are different. While a round-Trip carsharing member is more willing to drive towards more than one destination and does not always have his/her own car available, the free-floating carsharing member is more apt to use a point-To-point trip scheme driving for more than 15 minutes using the service as substitute of the owned car. © 2019 IEEE.","Intelligent systems; Sensitivity analysis; Binary logit model; Car rental systems; Carsharing; membership; Point to point; Public parking; supply; Synthetic populations; Intelligent vehicle highway systems, carsharing; membership; supply",English,Conference paper,257,4,Mobility and Transportation

Furthermore, ride sharing can be implemented within a sound economic regime through the involvement of commercial services that creates a win-win for all parties (e.g., Uber, Lyft or Sidecar). This positive thrust however is faced with several delaying factors, one of which is the volatility and unpredictability of the potential benefit (or utilization) of ride-sharing at different times, and in different places. Better understanding of ride-sharing dynamics can help policy makers and urban planners in increase the city's ""ride-sharing friendliness"" either by designing new ride-sharing oriented systems, as well as by providing ride-sharing service operators better tools to optimize their services. In this work the following research questions are posed: (a) Is ride-sharing utilization stable over time or does it undergo significant changes? (b) If ride-sharing utilization is dynamic can it be correlated with some traceable features of the traffic? and (c) If ride-sharing utilization is dynamic can it be predicted ahead of time? We analyze a dataset of over 14 million taxi trips taken in New York City. We propose a dynamic travel network approach for modeling and forecasting the potential ride-sharing utilization over time, showing it to be highly volatile. In order to model the utilization's dynamics, we propose a network-centric approach, projecting the aggregated traffic taken from continuous time periods into a feature space comprised of topological features of the network implied by this traffic. This feature space is then used to model the dynamics of ride-sharing utilization over time. The results of our analysis demonstrate the significant volatility of ride-sharing utilization over time, indicating that any policy, design, or plan that would disregard this aspect and chose a static paradigm would undoubtably be either highly inefficient or provide insufficient resources. We show that using our suggested approach it is possible to model the potential utilization of ride sharing based on the topological properties of the rides network. We also show that using this method the potential utilization can be forecasting a few hours ahead of time. One anecdotal derivation of the latter is that perfectly guessing the destination of a New York taxi rider becomes nearly three times easier than rolling a ""Snake Eyes"" at a casino. © 2019 Tal Altshuler et al.",", Continuous time systems; Dynamics; Forecasting; Taxicabs; Topology; Aggregated traffics; Commercial services; Modeling and forecasting; Modeling and predictions; Network-centric approach; Research questions; Topological features; Topological properties; Traffic congestion",English,Article,401,4,Mobility and Transportation

57220993600,Climate Smart Agriculture Edu-tourism: A Strategy to Sustain Grassroots Pro-biodiversity Entrepreneurship in the Philippines,2019,"The wide array of economic activities that sustain income generation creates human pressures that lead to biodiversity and habitat loss, rapid depletion of natural resources, environmental pollution, and climate change, among others. To dissuade the alarming rate of environmental degradation, pro-biodiversity enterprises are promoted and supported in the Philippines. These enterprises conserve biodiversity through the adoption of sustainable use practices and the utilization of biological resources toward equitable sharing of benefits. Organic farming is considered a pro-biodiversity enterprise. It is categorized by the Philippine Department of Agriculture under the Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA). CSA encompasses the application of climate-smart principles in agriculture to enhance the productivity and income, develop resiliency to climate change, and reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. There are a number of grassroots or community-based pro-biodiversity agri-entrepreneurs in the Philippines that complement their farm operations with education tourism activities or farm “edu-tourism” (rural tourism or agri-tourism). It is where tourists including entrepreneurs and technology adopters visit an agricultural farm to engage in learning experiences, meet with farmers, and understand their culture as well as practices in food production and marketing. CSA edu-tourism provides income to farmers from the sales of farm produce and demonstration of farm activities. The study defines the value-added features of CSA edu-tourism to planning, implementing, and managing community-based pro-biodiversity enterprises in the Philippines. The in-depth interview with organic farmers and entrepreneurs provided the multifarious benefits of CSA edu-tourism and emphasized how it promotes harmonization of communities with nature. The study also demonstrated the relationship between edu-tourism and grassroots pro-biodiversity entrepreneurship considering the environmental conservation approach of CSA. Further, the study determined the potential financial and cultural gains of pro-biodiversity entrepreneurs from CSA edu-tourism as basis in planning sustainable, climate-sensitive, and biodiversity-friendly grassroots enterprises. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Agri-tourism; Biodiversity; Biodiversity-friendly business; Edu-tourism; Education tourism; Farm tourism; Grassroots pro-biodiversity; Pro-biodiversity enterprises; Pro-biodiversity entrepreneurship",English,Book chapter,296,11,Rural Resource Management
26768296700,Responsible Tourism and Maritime Spatial Planning,2019,"Tourism is an industry strongly linked with global issues. In recent years, there has been a growing concern for tourism development according to standards that guarantee the preservation of ecological balance and the prevention of resource-overuse and other negative environmental effects. Although the ideas of respect and responsibility were inexorably connected to tourism since 1980, it is only in 2002 that the Cape Town Declaration outlined a number of priorities to be incorporated in the management of destinations and ultimately led to forms of responsible tourism in terms of social, economic and environmental sustainability. In this respect, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), as part of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, could make a significant contribution to sustainability, together with Maritime spatial planning (MSP), which supports and facilitates the implementation of the same strategy. Conceptually linked with CSR, MSP is a coastal management program that, operates at the international level and transparently involves stakeholders in the planning of maritime activities, in order to: plan when and where human activities take place at sea, and to ensure that these are done as efficiently and sustainably as possible. As part of EU’s ‘Blue Growth’ strategy, the coastal and maritime tourism sector has been identified as a key area, offering a potential for a smarter, sustainable and more inclusive Europe. According to the ‘ Blue Growth Study ’, coastal and maritime tourism, represents the largest maritime sector in terms of gross-value-added and employment; it is also expected to grow by 2–3% by 2020. In this context, this paper aims to identify and analyse the role of responsible tourism in MSP, focusing on the Romanian coast of the Black Sea. In the first part, an overview of the two concepts is presented; namely, CSR and MSP, their relationship and their main influence factors. The second part, will propose an implementation framework for a CSR approach in the local tourism industry, in accordance with the MSP principles, containing information on how to develop and implement a CSR strategy and commitments, in order to meet the demands of the coastal area responsible tourism. In this respect, local tourism stakeholders have a key role to play in defining the MSP local issues and needs. The purpose here is to raise the awareness of professionals, institutions and travellers, on what is at stake, and to underline the necessity and interest to change behaviours and regulations in line with responsible tourism goals. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",", Maritime spatial planning; Responsibility; Tourism",English,Book chapter,412,11,Rural Resource Management

Accessible built environments are required; so urban spaces, buildings, transport vehicles, information technology communication and services must include the process of “Age Sensitive Design” that attends to ageing and considers the perceptions of elderly people, who tend to have mobility, vision, hearing and cognitive issues or problems. Active ageing requires that there be an accessible tourism strategy, where the conditions related with elderly peoples’ mobility are important. The research project Accessibility for All in Tourism (ACCES4ALL) focuses on modal interfaces that are designed to be age friendly. Its main objective is to develop a pilot study: an accessible, smart and sustainable bus stop to be located at Faro International Airport. The layout is beyond the consideration of international technical norms and considers human diversity. The design process is collaborative, focusing on the users’ needs. It is a humanized process that requires an integrated team of civil engineering, architecture, geography, design, information, and communication and tourism professionals, who consider senior tourists’ perceptions of bus stop environments. A questionnaire was developed for the elderly tourist aged 60 or over, about their mobility and perceptions of bus stop environments, and the importance of some attributes for their mobility. This paper describes some results of the ACCES4ALL project that indicate elderly tourists have the perception of an accessible bus stop’s attributes, mainly in urbanistic aspects: sidewalks and bus stops with barrier-free space, non-slip surfaces, well lit, with soft ramps. They consider it important to have shelters with places to rest. Most consider that tactile and chromatic markings, QR (quick response) codes and near field communication (NFC) technology are not important for their mobility. © 2019 WIT Press.",", Accessibility; Accessible tourism; Age sensitive design; Bus stop; Collaborative design; Disability; Elderly people; Sustainable tourism; Tourism",English,Conference paper,301,3,Urban Sustainability

While designing urban system development, management, and reconstruction projects, both managers of the cities and urbanists must take into account the opinions of specialists, who have different categories of mindsets and they “talk different languages” (Sociologists, ecologists, businessmen, etc.). Summing up the aforementioned languages in a common denominator is possible only by mathematics and computing tools. Nowadays, the problems of city management are united in the concept of “Smart city”, which is usually referred to as “informational city”. “Smart City” – this is an integration concept, which involves the usage of the so called “integrated imitative model” for systematic, stable, optimal decision making, as the city is a whole dynamic unity. Today’s managers of the cities, urbanists, investors, businessmen, sociologists, etc. have to deal with a huge amount of parameters, opinions and data in a nonsystematic manner. Our proposed study “Unified Web Platform of the Region and Smart Management” includes: website, Google Map, pointing object in the map, saving the objects and their parameters, mathematical and programmatic tools, cloud computing, python computing libraries, Restful api as a web service, etc. As for the web service or restful api, any software can have access to the data of the united web platform of the region through a specially defined protocol. Objects presented in the map have assigned specialized and standardized parameters, which are used by the system algorithm for the analyses and the presentation of all the structural creators of the dynamic processes of the city. This gives us the opportunity to see the whole chain of interactions, which are caused by the actions on any object of the city. Users register on the website and they can see the parameters of the objects that are set in the map. The objects in the databases are classified by their purpose, affiliation, destination and other marks. There is an ability for users to define the status of an object on their own. Users can also add or remove objects on the map and can manipulate with the updated parameters on the map. They can evaluate the chain of results both in the time and dimensional manner. For the built-in mathematical tools and algorithms in the system, we use Algebraic topology methods, Graphs theory non-linear differential equations, the theory of disasters and bifurcation, Chaos theory, methods of mathematical statistics and more. Web platform includes all the mathematical tools and programmatic packages that are necessary for stable development of small and medium-sized business. © 2019 Franco Angeli Edizioni.

The definition of SI is yet not clear from the literature; thus, it is usually mixed with accessibility, and availability of transit service. This study revisits the supply index estimation problem with the more detailed and robust approach. A route-based equation is developed in which the variables include walk buffer areas of stops, the total area of the zone, straightness of route provided to that zone, and average Available Seating Capacity (ASC) of transit services. The equation provides Origin-Destination (OD) based SI, that is SI for each OD pair. Furthermore, the equation also incorporates the number of transfers needed to travel from the origin zone to the destination zone and speed between those zones. Most of the data required for analysis are taken from either static Google Transit Feed Specifications (GTFS) or smartcard data. Though the analysis is only carried out at a few OD pairs, when the method is applied to all zones it is expected to provide detailed insight into the transit supply, therefore can be helpful for planners to visualize and improve the complex and cumbersome networks in a more effective manner. © 2019 Australasian Transport Research Forum, ATRF 2019 - Proceedings.

54783187100,From Smart Cities to Smart Buildings—Tools for Promoting Cultural Heritage,2019,"Changing Europe to be smart, sustainable and inclusive, able to generate and manage high employment levels, productivity, and cohesion is a still goal which is hard to attain which launches several challenges in the field of growth. With a background of deep structural changes, and also some extremely favorable developments, the tourism industry has turned into a sector playing a decisive role in attaining Europe 2020 goals. Cultural heritage is a fundamental resource of sustainable development, but also a basic factor for differentiating the touristic products. In this respect, we can notice that cultural heritage has as a background the need of integrating the touristic resource (natural and cultural) within the local community, but also the need to avoid that this process would lead to alteration, deterioration or even loss of the cultural heritage. The attractiveness of a tourist destination depends on the degree to which it succeeds in satisfying demand. In this context, the role of cultural heritage is defining, due to its uniqueness, and to the multitude of individualized possibilities in some of its complex packages, based on natural resources, cultural–historical heritage, personalized services, etc. Cultural heritage, especially for low-income communities, represents an important asset and a significant source of finance for local budgets. Promoting smart buildings on the internet and creating digital access solution for them, may lead to a new understanding in the public administration of smart cities. Our chapter aims to point out the opportunities emerging for small communities in the cultural heritage management area. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",", Cultural heritage; Smart building; Smart city; Tourism development",English,Conference paper,260,3,Urban Sustainability

Enterprising activities in the cities have emerged as the backbone of the economy of cities across the globe. Efforts have been made in many countries to build or transform cities to reinforce entrepreneurship and in the process develop enterprising cities. In the wake of arguments for building enterprising cities in South Africa, this study examined the dimensions of enterprising cities, the status of cities in terms of entrepreneurial attributes and strategies essential for building enterprising cities in South Africa. A Delphi research method was adopted for the study. The study revealed that enterprising cities have distinct dimensions such as economic land scape (Industrial and service activities), entrepreneurial friendly policy, smart infrastructure (both transportation and communication), capacity to attract investment, international embeddedness, research and development and innovation, smart technology, enabled quality communication, and distinct economic image. The South African cities currently do not portray distinct images of entrepreneurial cities at both regional or global level. The paper argues that a combination of strategies for reinforcing economic and social and spatial related entrepreneurial attributes in addition to the strengthening of entrepreneurship policy for creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem will assist in creating enterprising cities in South Africa in which tourists as well as locals can find value. © 2019 AJHTL.",", Cities; Entrepreneurship; Information communication technology; Innovation; Investment",English,Article,215,11,Rural Resource Management

However, a CB route will not make profit if there is not enough demand between the pair of long-distance Origin and Destination (OD). To overcome this limitation, we propose a new form of CB which is more friendly to shorter distances and lower level of demand. Network design of this new form of CB is different from conventional bus, since the design of CB is specific to every passenger. Neither can we view it as a multi-route VRP, because CB demands are not single-origin deliveries or single-destination pick-ups. We develop an algorithm basing on HeuSDP (a hybrid heuristic algorithm used for VRPSDP) to solve our CB network design problem. The computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm efficiently obtains satisfactory solution for small-scaled situations. © 2010 23th International Conference on Architecture of Computing Systems 2010, ARCS 2010 - Workshop Proceedings.

Recently, smart cards have been introduced in many metropolises, which, however, do not reveal explicitly the actual routes of the cardholders. Research literature shows that a finite mixture model (FMM) may provide an efficient approach to inferring the route choices; still, it can be rendered ineffective when the data sample size is small. To overcome this issue, we introduce the concept of ‘superstations’, which is a group of stations from/to which passengers have similar route choice patterns. From that, a larger data sample can be available for a superstation-to-superstation origin destination pair, so as to regain a functional FMM and enhance its fitness for inferring the passengers’ route choices.

The main aim of this study is to reveal the different effects and correlations of the socioeconomic variables and railway supply factors for different cities. Some conclusions can be drawn from the analysis: The relative size of the tourists, as well as the proportion of the employees in the tertiary industry, the GDP of the tertiary industry and the integral railway mileage, affects the dynamics of passenger departures volume in different cities in different ways. Under the grey relation analysis, the forecast of the passenger departures volume in each city is conducted with the help of grey prediction models showing that cities with different socioeconomic situations have different growth trends. © 2010 23th International Conference on Architecture of Computing Systems 2010, ARCS 2010 - Workshop Proceedings.

This research created a typology of transit stations based on station area accessibility (to jobs, housing, and key destinations), considering the amount of transit service in the station area, the area’s urban design characteristics, and the number of jobs and population that are accessible. A large dataset on transit stations and corridors was then used to populate the typology. About a quarter of current stations were in the highly accessible category while nearly 20% were in the low access category. Several proxies for livability, including levels of transit and auto use, transportation and housing costs, greenhouse gas emissions per household, and levels of obesity, were used to compare the high accessibility stations, that is, those with highly integrated transportation and land use, with the stations in the low accessibility bin. The high accessibility, highly integrated stations performed better in every category-providing important quality of life outcomes for people who could access them-important findings in light of a growing need for Ethical and Equitable Livability for all. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Within this context, urban tourism planning is experiencing a convergence of new paradigms related to the so-called Smart Tourist Destinations (SD). Smart tourism and its operational level open up new avenues for intervention in the city which can help to manage overtourism. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyse the level of implementation of smart solutions in four Spanish destinations: Donostia-San Sebastián, Madrid, Málaga and Valencia. The methodology used combines the compilation of information on initiatives and measures found in public tourism planning documents with semi-structured interviews with those responsible for managing the Smart City strategy and the SD project. The results reveal that there is a gap between the SD approaches, the level of implementation of smart solutions and their operability in relation to the management of tourist overload. Almost no technological solutions have been developed to address this issue, which is barely perceived as a problem by local governments. However, the need to generate knowledge that is useful for managing tourist overload constitutes a challenge faced by a growing number of destinations. © 2019 Asociacion de Geografos Espanoles.

Thus, brand equity plays an important role in the achievement of those objectives. Simultaneously, the integration of ICT has leaded to the concept of “smart tourist destinations”. With this in mind, the main goal of our paper is to develop a model of smart destination equity from the point of view of residents (i.e. a key stakeholder of tourist destinations since they project the image of their places and influence the tourist experience). In particular, our model includes smart services linked to safety, health, heritage, mobility, and environment. Our results confirm that smart destination equity is formed by awareness, image, perceived quality, and loyalty.

However, few approaches considered route planning data. The data come from mobile map applications where some travelers plan their trips before departure. To some extents, they imply future OD demand. Motivated by this, the paper compares the volumes of planned trips and actually occurred trips extracted from trajectory data. Strong correlation (more than 0.97) exists between them. Planned trips are generally more than actual trips, especially for long-distance travel (64% more). For morning and evening peak hours, their volumes fluctuate more. These conclusions show the value of route planning data for OD estimation and prediction.

The travel patterns of users that take advantage of smart devices to ride a shared-bicycle in two large cities (Chicago and Budapest) have been investigated, with analysis of approximately two million transaction data records associated with bike trips made over a three-month period in each location. Several aspects of user travel behavior—such as day and time of travel, frequency of usage, duration of usage, seasonal and peak/off-peak variations, major origin/destinations—have been included in this analysis. The results show that in both cities the bike-sharing option is a male-dominated alternative, particularly welcomed by younger groups, with the largest share of trips occurring in the afternoon peak. Appropriate usage of open-source big-data provides important lessons for successful vehicle sharing models, allowing the application of the findings to other cities and mobility options where these systems are still developing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Behavioral research; Big data; Carrier mobility; Open systems; Urban planning; Budapest; Large cities; Open sources; Sharing systems; Smart devices; Transaction data; Travel behaviors; Travel patterns; Bicycles, Big data; Bike-sharing systems; Mobility; User travel behavior",English,Conference paper,154,4,Mobility and Transportation

They can provide, for instance, real-time information of traffic, local buses and time taken to reach an specific destination to help travellers plan their trips and improve their safety and comfort. Countries such as Japan, United States, Chile and Peru have initiatives for implementing their nation-wide ITS. In Colombia, there are many local ITS services implemented by local authorities, national offices and commercial companies. However, these solutions remain largely isolated one to the others, implying not only the duplication of efforts but also limits to the information that these services provide. In addition, Colombia has not defined some technical standards that may support the implementation and integration of the ITS in the country. This paper presents some conclusions of the panel discussion held in the Workshop on Intelligent Transportation Systems (WITS 2018) regarding opportunities and challenges to implement ITS in Colombia: It is important to define a plan that prioritize the ITS systems to develop, to define technical standards that support their integration at regional and national levels, and to promote coordinated efforts of academy, industry and government to implement these solution. © 2018 IEEE.","Computer software reusability; Highway planning; Intelligent systems; Standards; Intelligent transportation systems; ITS architecture; Local authorities; Multiple systems; Panel discussions; Real-time information; Technical standards; Transport problems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems, Intelligent Transportation Systems; ITS architecture; ITS planning",English,Conference paper,210,4,Mobility and Transportation

56236748300,Possibilities for linguistic summaries in cognitive cities,2019,"The shift to smart cities, and further to cognitive cities, should follow citizens’ needs, and not only the efficient use of resources. Citizens wish to cooperate in decision-making (or voting) and to be informed about various developments in cities, preferably in comprehensible ways. But, summing up from a large amount of data and gamut of data types is not an easy task. Furthermore, many concepts and predicates are expressed by adjectives and adverbs. Hence, the option are linguistic summaries based on the fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic theory. Other stakeholders in cities (dispatchers, planners, marketers, local government, journalists) may also benefit from this approach. Linguistic summaries are able to verbalize mined information from the data by quantified sentences of natural language such as most of young citizens have rather negative opinion about topic T and most of foreign visits are from countries with medium GDP. Illustrative examples are focused on informing citizens, managing surveys, explaining development in pollution and traffic, analysing tourist activities. In this way, stakeholders are informed in a concise way about the situation and trends. They can also recognize the effects of regulations which had been brought in. Another benefit is that citizens are better prepared for voting. This contribution also emphasizes the fact that these achievements can be realized without collecting sensitive data from citizens using them as sensors (except volunteers, which prefer simpler data collection). Moreover, exchange of summaries is not as demanding as exchanging sensitive data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,English,Book chapter,248,3,Urban Sustainability

16319641700,"Lessons from a Small Island - Density, Spatial Development, and Identity",2019,"Below we explore the relationship between culture and urban design in order to situate why this important interaction remains a somewhat vexed issue, one somewhat unexplored in the urban design literature. Our chosen site is the tropical paradise of Bali, a world renowned island famous for its culture and environment. Being physically isolated both geographically and culturally from the rest of Indonesia, Bali provides a unique opportunity to advance our knowledge of relationships critical to an urban design awareness. On the surface, urban density, a defining quality of cities is a central focus, round which issues of cultural identity revolve. In contention is the fact that the density of built form across the island is controlled by a single regulation, with the justification that it protects Balinese traditional culture. The following paper reveals not only that this relationship is illusory, but also that ideology is critical to our understanding. Traditional 'cultural' explanations are insufficiently encompassing. An archaeology of other factors that affect local culture interact in complex ways - a violent recent history, economic exploitation, global tourism and identity. Standing well outside the vocabulary of mainstream urban design yet formative of urban culture, these forces must be paid homage. They also exist within the realm of ideological formations suggesting that the culture: urban design relationship must be contained within a general acceptance of ideology as formative in urban space, since they bridge the gap between culture and the material base of Balinese Society. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Our team, composed of heritage architects, conducted an immersive workshop in the valley for the identification, survey, knowledge and production of restoration project and safeguard granaries, a unique heritage in Morocco. Our article is a synthesis of moments of reflection, observations, conclusions and results that we have conducted in the field. The climatic and geographical conditions being very difficult, the availability of cultivable land being scarce, the inhabitant of Aits Bouguemaz developed a spatial intelligence, which in order to adapt with the places whose topography is very uneven, produced a habitat with singular architecture. Thus two zones stand out: Traditional areas of irrigated farming with a community organization and zones of dry culture marked by a dispersion or even an isolation. This physical reality of the valley has generated an original architecture, which is declined in three architectural sets of inhabited: Ighrem 1, Tighremt2 and Tigmi3, appellations of Berber origin and that we will discuss in our article. In recent decades, the arrival of roads and electricity or migration to cities has had a direct impact on the social changes of the valley's inhabitants. The results we observed in the field are the changes in the spatial organization of the housing projects. From community or family home has become isolated and single family. Consequently, these large dwellings with their singular architecture have been emptied of their inhabitants, often abandoned, or sometimes, for some, have known a destiny of their different function. In our intention and to illustrate this mutation in the practice of the space built by the inhabitants we chose two sites: The Tighrem of Ait Louakhoumi, which became a space of partial storage and thus in course of total abandonment. And, the attic of Sidi Moussa, which has managed its transformation from a communal collective attic into a sanctuary of the valley, and a must for tourists in the region. © International Research Publication House.",", Ait Bouguemez; Centrality; Decentralization; Ighrem; Tighremt; Vernacular architecture",English,Article,355,3,Urban Sustainability

As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and ‘smart’ urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surrey's growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surrey's multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups – children and youth (0–19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) – we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the city's hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to ~9000 and ~124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 min by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as ~8000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the city's schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people – almost half of them seniors – will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 min by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities.

There are many services provided by it like a ticket, catering, etc. Ticketing system has evolved from paper ticketing system to electronic ticketing system. In a metro train, the system provides smart card where a passenger can recharge and buy tickets using that, this may be regular or seasonal ticket smart card which will calculate the fare for travel. In order to book tickets for long distance travel, passengers can buy e-ticket via an internet or can in person at railway stations. In case of e-ticket, the tickets would be validated by ticket examiner (TTE) with a valid original identity proof. Passengers will be in trouble if they forget to take the ID card. Lack of Ticket Examiner leads minimal verification of the passenger's ticket. In the proposed system by the use of online services with the internet, passengers can add their own unique national Identity proof (Aadhaar card) while booking tickets, which helps automatic ticket validation. Biometric checks of the passenger take place at the entrance and exit of each compartment of the train. With the help of cloud storage, the details can be validated by comparing Aadhaar database. In case of mismatching tickets alarm rings and alert message will be sent to Ticket Examiner. Using GPS on a train, location can be obtained and the source and destination of the passenger can be validated. Checking at the exit path, the destination can be checked and can avoid the persons travelling long distance with short distance travelling ticket. Also, the system prevents the person travels without buying tickets. The proposed system is implemented using Raspberry Pi, fingerprint scanner and GPS Receiver. © 2018, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

There are several geosites in this geopark along the coastline included in 8 districts. This study area is marked by the presence of Cimandiri active fault in the form of river mouth to the bay. The active fault zone is home to several epicentres of shallow earthquakes in the study area. This paper is aimed to highlight the needs of creating disaster resilience community toward the safe live-able environment. Methodology in this study consists of analysing geological hazard potential maps and communities distribution in the built environment related to geotourism. Result of study shows that the geopark assignment has attract more tourists and visitors to this area than before. Some locations of geosites are found vulnerable of geological disaster such as earthquake and tsunami. It is relatively unsafe for the inhabitants and visitors when this geological event occurs. Several communities have attention to build disaster resilience through education stakeholders as well as disaster awareness for the public. It can be concluded that the ideas of disaster resilience for community are already started to be implemented eventhough there is still a lot work to do in supporting the safe live-able environment especially in facing the geotourism development in the study area. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

It attracts transportation researchers in recent times and invites businesses to test its market feasibility. The key aspect of MaaS is the integration of multimodal transport information services, which remind us of a project from years ago about journey planning systems. This chapter offers to revisit an FP7 funded project with survey of journey planning system and assesses it against the current state-of-play of journey planning systems as referred in MaaS. Much development such as dynamic data supply, multimodality information and digital map presentations have improved with technologies such as broadband generation and personal mobile devices' capabilities. However, the challenge for MaaS market uptake remains as similar to journey planning system products.

They comprise several habitat types, from remnant patches of native vegetation, urban wastelands, gardens, yards, etc., to highly engineered green infrastructures, such as green walls/roofs and bioswales. Landscape planners are increasingly aware about the need to re-connect, through the urban-rural gradient, the endangered urban biodiversity with the surrounding natural areas. This need is even more urgent in case of urban settlements experiencing a remarkable growth in their population due to a heavy increase of tourism flows. This is the case of the City of Matera (Southern Italy), an UNESCO site currently selected as the European Cultural Capital 2019, which is facing an impressive growth in tourism population and relevant services.

By the end of the year 2019, Malaysia will have close to 700 shopping centres in total net lettable area of 170 million sq ft. Malaysia shopping centre industry offers more than 166.6 million square feet of the net lettable area with an estimated real estate value of RM130 billion. Retails contribution to the GDP could expand by 15 per cent from the current 10 per cent in the next five years and it could get better with tourism growth. For the second quarter of 2018, Malaysia's retail industry reported a growth rate of 2.1 per cent in retail sales, compared to the same period in 2017. However, Malaysia's established centre operators recorded an average occupancy rate of 92% in 2018, according to a survey conducted by the Malaysia Shopping Centres Association (PPK). For 671 of shopping centres surveyed in the second half of the year, the average monthly gross rental rate per square feet of net lettable area was found to be RM7.87, while the average monthly expenses over the same area was RM3.07. One way to fill the centres, both new and existing, is tourism. The centres must be interactive. It must have things like artificial intelligence that interact with people. There should be new dynamics in shopping. Centre owners must keep abreast with the latest trends. Pricing and design must be right. Centres are also adding more food and beverage (F&B) outlets, tenants mix and branded outlets. The developers who are looking to set up centres should consider location and connectivity include concept, target market, mixture of tenants, security, parking, cleanliness and making the centres interactive.

Using smart card and social media data to understand urban mobility",2019,"This study describes the integration and analysis of travel smart card data (SCD) with points of interest (POIs) from social media for a case study in Shenzhen, China. SCD ticket price with tap-in and tap-out times was used to identify different groups of travellers. The study examines the temporal variations in mobility, identifies different groups of users and characterises their trip purpose and identifies sub-groups of users with different travel patterns. Different groups were identified based on their travel times and trip costs. The trip purpose associated with different groups was evaluated by constructing zones around metro station locations and identifying the POIs in each zone. Each POI was allocated to one of six land use types, and each zone was allocated a set of land use weights based on the number of POI check-ins for the POIs in that zone. Trip purpose was then inferred from trip time linked to the land use at the origin and destination zones using a novel “land use change rate” measure. A cluster analysis was used to identify sub-groups of users based on individual temporal travel patterns, which were used to generate a novel “boarding time profile”. The results show how different groups of users can be identified and the differences in trip times and trip purpose quantified between and within groups. Limitations of the study are discussed and a number of areas for further work identified, including linking to socioeconomic data and a deeper consideration of the timestamps of POI check-ins to support the inference of dynamic and multiple land uses at one location. The methods and metrics developed by this research use social media POI data to semantically contextualise information derived from the SCD and to overcome the drawbacks and limitations of traditional travel survey data. They are novel and generalizable to other studies. They quantify spatiotemporal mobility patterns for different groups of travellers and infer how their purposes of their journeys change through the day. In so doing, they support a more nuanced and detailed view of who, where, when and why people use city spaces. © 2019 by the authors",", Big data; Individual mobility; Smart card data; Social media; Urban analytics",English,Article,351,4,Mobility and Transportation

There is a review of works and projects devoted to city transformations caused by great dissemination of new media in urban spaces. The author suggests us critical view on “smart cities” and address alternative approach in city planning - “involvement to city”. The author makes analysis of modern social transformations in the urban environment caused by influence of new media and offers the classification of different forms of urban medialization. Among them there are new technologies in a smart city (mobile payments, smart cards, etc.), acted spaces (urban activism, social networks, mobile applications), navigation signs (tourist online maps), informational Interactive desks (QR code, smart boards, new journalism), transferring the logic of new media to urban development (construction of the urban environment according to the laws of new media) and online tracking (video cameras, sensors). Sometimes we even can't notice how much modern technologies and new media influence on our everyday life. But new media changes not only physical spaces of cities; also, it shapes new digital social spaces and citizens practices. This study sheds light on characteristics of mobile digital practices in the Russian context, especially in arctic cities. Author argues use of the term “interactive city” and “media city” as a more voluminous concept for arctic cities. According to authors hypothesis problems and challenges of arctic cities (geographical remoteness, weather conditions, and infrastructural imperfections) can be solved by opportunities of modern technologies, mostly by the opportunities of so-called acted space when new technologies allow inhabitants to talk with the city and to create an acted urban space. The aim of this paper is identification of social practices of “smart crowds” in arctic cities and prediction of its role in further city planning and making recommendations for city's administration.

14033105100; 57204469180; 7003652508; 57203828230,Ride-sharing with travel time uncertainty,2018,"Travel time uncertainty has significant effects on travel reliability and travelers’ generalized trip cost. However, travel time uncertainty has not been considered in existing ride-sharing models, leading to an inaccurate estimation of the benefit from ride-sharing and irrational ride-sharing matches. To fill in the gap, this paper proposes a stochastic ride-sharing model, in which travel time is assumed to be stochastic and follow a time-independent general distribution that has a positive lower bound. Due to travel time uncertainty, travelers may not arrive at their destinations on time. Different from the traditional models taking time windows as hard constraints, the proposed ride-sharing system only requires each participant announcing a role and the desired arrival time window. In the model, the generalized trip cost consists of the cost of driving a vehicle, the cost of travel time, and the cost of schedule delay early and late. This study investigates the effect of the unit variable cost of driving, travelers’ values of time (VOTs), and travel time uncertainty on the cost saving of ride-sharing trips compared to driving-alone trips. A bi-objective ride-sharing matching model is proposed to maximize both the total generalized trip cost saving and the number of matches. The proposed ride-sharing model is further extended to consider time-dependent travel time uncertainty, and the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is developed to evaluate the mean generalized trip cost. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the properties of the two proposed models. The results show that the unit variable cost of driving, travelers’ VOTs, travel time uncertainty, and the selection of the weight in the objective function have significant impacts on the performance of the proposed ride-sharing system with travel time uncertainty. The results also show that a feasible ride-sharing match based on deterministic travel time can become infeasible in a stochastic ride-sharing system. It is therefore important to consider travel time uncertainty when determining the matches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cost accounting; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Traffic control; Feasible match; Monte carlo simulations (MCS); Objective functions; Ride-sharing; Time independents; Traditional models; Travel time uncertainty; Trip cost; arrival time; travel time; uncertainty analysis; Travel time, Feasible match; Generalized trip cost; Ride-sharing; Travel time uncertainty",English,Article,319,4,Mobility and Transportation

This paper analyses whether climate-smart agriculture policy meets the demands of climate justice and respects the rights of smallholders; and if not, how it could be amended. The study is based on a literature review supplemented by four interviews with climate-smart agriculture actors from diverse backgrounds: a consultant, a smallholder farmer, a practitioner, and a scientist. To examine the climate-smart agriculture concept and its implementation, the following ethical positions are considered: maximalist, minimalist, Pogge's intermediate position, Nussbaum's capability approach, Kantian, and Altruist. The study finds that current climate-smart agriculture approaches are not being fairly implemented because there is the unjust sharing of benefits of income and burdens of emission reduction costs, among smallholders and agro-industries. According to the principles of climate justice, this sharing proportion should be equally distributed based on an individual's capacities and poverty should be taken into consideration as well. Climate-smart agriculture should be fair for the farmers; it should not only push and promote agribusiness expansion. The power of multinational corporations has substantially altered global agrifood chains to the detriment of small farmers and the environment. The mandatory inclusion of local, regional and national level civil society organisations and networks holds the potential for a more fair implementation of climate-smart agriculture.

This has led to a wide range of consequences that have added pressure on the groundwater systems in this part of the world. Among such pressures, we can cite the mal-distribution and the irregularity of precipitation and ice, flooding, evaporitic sediments input by the drainage net, water degradation, mud stagnation in dams, dead tranche, drought, decreasing of the natural recharge and increasing of the groundwater abstraction, conflict between trans-boundary waters, desertification, imbalance between the regions, migration, revolution, socio-economic imbalance, etc. Actually, water-monitoring networks indicate noticeable hydrogeologic variations and a rise of the groundwater salinity. It was confirmed by the geochemical analysis of water resources that showed scattered data between the northern part characterized by low mineralized groundwater (TDS ranging 0.4–3 g/l) and the southern area where the salinity ranges from 2.5 to 90 g/l. The obtained values are far above the permissible limits for both human consumption, agricultural and tourist activities. These effects, when compounded, are anticipated to worsen the situation and to constitute veritable threats for social and economic development in these regions of North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, etc.). The potential solutions consist of taking urgent to utilize the intelligent technology (bio and nano-technology), policies relevant policies to manage water resources, and the engagement of private, civil, and international sectors if a major crisis is to be averted (collective effort). © 2018, The Author(s).",", Climate change; North Africa; Water quality; Water resources",English,Article,248,11,Rural Resource Management

The co-evolution of green place branding and policy tourism in Växjö, Sweden",2018,"More and more cities around the world are adopting green-city labels and are making use of their urban environmental policymaking for the purpose of place branding. However, the nature of the relationship between the branding of green cities and urban environmental policymaking is contested. Some researchers have highlighted so-called ‘greenwashing’ and the cherry-picking of easily attained goals. Others argue that green branding is driven by altruism, rather than intra-urban competition and entrepreneurialism. Drawing on literatures on policy tourism and green place branding, this article presents a longitudinal study of green branding in Växjö, Sweden. It contributes to the debate on green place branding by showing how two sets of contradictory impulses – entrepreneurialism/competition versus altruism/cooperation, and cherry-picking/greenwashing versus comprehensive environmental policymaking – affect the relationship between green place branding and environmental policy. In particular, the analysis illuminates the changing role played by policy tourism in shaping both the development of environmental policies and branding practices. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2018.","Kronoberg; Sweden; Vaxjo; altruism; coevolution; economic development; entrepreneur; environmental policy; greenspace; local government; policy making; smart city; tourism, economic development; local government; place branding; policy boosterism; policy tourism; Växjö",English,Article,161,11,Rural Resource Management

However, these requirements are not always adhered to for a variety of reasons even in cases of new constructions. Moreover, already existing structures and/or historical buildings built prior to such mobility requirements were put into force must be retrofitted. Consequently, a significant number of potential interesting locations are not accessible to persons with reduced mobility. For this reason, the focus of our research is on the expected content and availability of detailed mobility related information and how to improve the communication of accessibility information to users in order to evaluate the accessibility potential of public places and spaces to help persons with reduced mobility plan their outings by taking advantage of smart data and people in cities. © Authors 2018.","Accessibility mapping; Disabled tourists; Geovisualisation; Reduced mobility, Artificial intelligence; Earth sciences; Remote sensing; Building requirements; Disabled tourists; Existing structure; Geovisualisation; Historical buildings; New constructions; Persons with reduced mobilities; Public places; Software engineering",English,Conference paper,139,4,Mobility and Transportation
57203759333; 36657151800; 36550317100,A robust method for estimating transit passenger trajectories using automated data,2018,"Development of an origin-destination demand matrix is crucial for transit planning. The development process is facilitated by automated transit smart card data, making it possible to mine boarding and alighting patterns on an individual basis. This research proposes a novel trip chaining method which uses Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data to infer the most likely trajectory of individual transit passengers. The method relaxes the assumptions on various parameters used in the existing trip chaining algorithms such as transfer walking distance threshold, buffer distance for selecting the boarding location, time window for selecting the vehicle trip, etc. The method also resolves issues related to errors in GPS location recorded by AFC systems or selection of incorrect sub-route from GTFS data. The proposed trip chaining method generates a set of candidate trajectories for each AFC tag to reach the next tag, calculates the probability of each trajectory, and selects the most likely trajectory to infer the boarding and alighting stops. The method is applied to transit data from the Twin Cities, MN, which has an open transit system where passengers tap smart cards only once when boarding (or when alighting on pay-exit buses). Based on the consecutive tags of the passenger, the proposed algorithm is also modified for pay-exit cases. The method is compared to previous methods developed by the researchers and shows improvement in the number of inferred cases. Finally, results are visualized to understand the route ridership and geographical pattern of trips. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic Fare Collection (AFC); General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS); Smart card data; Transit; Transit origin-destination (O-D) Matrix; Trip chaining algorithm, Minneapolis; Minnesota; United States; Genetic algorithms; Smart cards; Specifications; Trajectories; Candidate trajectories; Development process; Fare collections; General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS); Geographical patterns; Origin destination; Origin-destination matrix; Transit; algorithm; bus transport; estimation method; GPS; trajectory; transportation development; transportation planning; walking; Matrix algebra",English,Article,252,4,Mobility and Transportation

With some methodologies within a unique framework considering current increasing construction sprawls and ecological consequences, these approaches will overcome existing shortcomings, especially spatial decision and visual impact problems on sustainable rural housing planning and construction. This paper presents a distinct web-based graphic model of sustainable rural housing planning and construction with a Fuzzy-DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory/Multi-Criteria-Spatial Decision Support System (F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS) method in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment applied to Alange, Spain as a case study. The aim of this methodology is to optimally eco-design rural housings under (mass)-tourism in reservoir areas, as for their sensitivity and effect. The methodology presents herein the combined method of GIS and Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) together with F-DEMATEL method. Because of the technological improvements in the area of information systems, it has a great necessity to study in what way to combine GIS, MCDA, Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), sensitivity analysis, the Internet, modeling, and database, targeting to generate MC-SDSS based on a web-based platform. A methodological framework named as web-based F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS is suggested by means of a totally united GIS and definite MCDA model by programed in ArcGIS software's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and Model View Controller (MVC) to be an object-oriented system. These program languages interact on an algorithmic web server that processing the MCDA products. The model consists of four main modules: the general overview module, the F-DEMATEL/MC-SDSS module, the sensitivity analysis module, and, finally, the final result module especially with the buildings suitability option, which users can access consecutively. Through the web graphic model developed, seven rural housings constructed in the area can be checked their suitability based on the selected criteria of decision-makers. Therefore, the results can be used to verify sustainable housings’ sites and designs differentiated parts of space as the asynchronous process of decision-makings.

To this end, the methodological approach relied on a survey over three months to record smart-card validations. Peak and off-peak periods have been defined according to validation frequency. Then, the origin-destination matrix has been estimated using the time interval between two validations to outline the different legs of the journey. Finally, transport demand has been matched with existing bus services, showing which areas were not adequately covered by public transport. The results of this research could assist public transport operators and local authorities in the design of a more suitable transport supply and mobility services in accordance with user needs.

7102220082,Getting smart about urban mobility – Aligning the paradigms of smart and sustainable,2018,"The digital age continues its advance, bringing with it remarkable technological possibilities. Such possibilities are founded upon an increasingly fine-grained electronic connectivity of people, places and objects allied to powerful data gathering and processing capabilities. Urban mobility of the future could be transformed, with developments such as: new forms of propulsion; new forms of vehicle control; changing business models of ownership and use; mobile technologies that equip and empower individuals; and opportunities to undertake activities without the need to travel. 'smart’ is the order of the day. Smart urban mobility conjures up a sense of new opportunity; of progress. However, what is really meant by smart? This paper examines this question, revealing a lack of consensus in terms of smart cities and a paucity of literature seeking to make sense of smart urban mobility. The paper considers how smart relates to sustainable, raising concerns about potentially dichotomous constituencies of commentators and discourses. Critical commentary associated with smart includes caution that large corporations are exerting significant influence in the era of smart in pursuit of goals that may not strongly align with those of urban planners concerned with social and environmental sustainability as well as economic prosperity. The paper puts forward and explores the following definition of smart urban mobility: “connectivity in towns and cities that is affordable, effective, attractive and sustainable”. This is intended to help draw the paradigms of smart and sustainable closer together towards a common framework for urban mobility development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Control system synthesis; Data handling; Intelligent systems; Smart city; Sustainable development; Tourism industry; Traffic control; Data gathering and processing; Economic prosperity; Electronic connectivity; ICTs; Intelligent transport systems; Social and environmental; Sociotechnical; Urban mobility; information and communication technology; intelligent transportation system; mobility; smart city; sustainability; urban area; urban transport; Urban transportation, ICTs; Intelligent transport systems; Smart cities; Smart urban mobility; Sociotechnical; Sustainable urban mobility",English,Article,247,3,Urban Sustainability

Centred on religious theme parks and urban beautification, the boom captures Sikkim's emphasis on tourism as a development strategy. Growth in hydropower and pharmaceutical industries within the state, and infrastructure enabling this growth, seek to reduce dependency on the Indian government and have turned Sikkim into a ‘backyard’ for Indian capital. In contrast, Namchi epitomizes the transition from rural to urban space through tourism-led growth, creating a ‘front yard’ exhibit which was recently awarded Smart City status despite its small size and relative unimportance. This article explores Namchi's boom by analysing the politics that drive it, the buildings and landscapes that capture its excess, and the town's lived urban spaces. The authors focus on three aspects of Namchi's boom: first, it is crucial for projections of success in Sikkim and aligns urban transformation with a particular vision of development actively promoted by the Chief Minister and ruling party; second, it is not based on resource extraction or agrarian expansion but on funds transferred to cultivate and reward loyalty in this border region; and third, it is drawing migrant workers to the town in large numbers, causing fissures and tensions, and simultaneously creating an emergent, though uneasy, cosmopolitanism. © 2018 International Institute of Social Studies",,English,Article,227,3,Urban Sustainability

Such smart card technologies provide new opportunities for transportation data collection since the transaction data obtained through AFC system contains a significant amount of archived information which can be gathered and leveraged to help estimate public transit origin–destination matrices. Boarding location detection is an important step particularly when there is no automatic vehicle location (AVL) system or GPS information in the database in some cases. With the analysis of raw data without AVL information in this paper, an algorithm for trip direction detection is built and the directions for any bus in operation can be confirmed. The transaction interval between each adjacent record will also be analyzed to detect the boarding clusters for all trips in sequence. Boarding stops will then be distributed with the help of route information and operation schedules. Finally, the feasibility and practicality of the methodology are tested using the bus transit smart card data collected in Guangzhou, China. © 2018, The Author(s).",", Automated fare collection; Boarding location inference; Transit smart card",English,Article,182,4,Mobility and Transportation

The analysis focuses on the impacts of a diverse set of innovative drivers of urban value creation and sustainable solutions for city development (urban functions), which are collectively subsumed under the heading of 'sustainable smart city’. Recognizing that the dynamics and growth processes related to these urban functions may have different impacts on different types of stakeholders, potentially leading to the emergence of serious conflicts between guests/visitors and residents, we aim to derive model-based implications for urban and tourism management in the cities concerned in order to move towards the sustainable future city as ‘a place 4 all’. The results of our latent growth curve model confirm the existence of different impacts of urban functions on visitors' and residents' attractiveness. Cultural dynamics appears to be a major determinant for attracting new residents and supporting a strong international tourism industry. From an economic perspective, purely economic strength (in terms of absolute growth) appears to enhance city attractiveness for residents, while the dynamics observed in research and development activities influences the quality of employment instead of being a direct driver of population growth. While the social aspects of sustainability (framed under the concept of livability) and the urban environment typically exert higher impacts on urban attractiveness, accessibility appears mostly relevant for visitors. Our analysis suggests an uneasy balance between livability, environment, and population and visitor volume and growth. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Creative city; Livability; Smart city; Sustainability; Urban attractiveness; Urban management performance, smart city; structural analysis; sustainability; tourism management; tourist destination; urban area",English,Article,257,3,Urban Sustainability

However, measures to reduce the frequency of public transport services are under consideration in such cities because the number of passengers and the income necessary to keep services in operation are both decreasing. This study empirically analyzes the change in the number of tram passengers after the frequency of service was reduced in the study area. Especially, an analysis is applied to a survival time model using smart card data to evaluate what origin–destination pairs between tram stops (tram OD) can maintain a suitable number of passengers. The parameters estimated in the model show that a reduction in the number of trams does not directly lead to a change in the number of tram OD passengers. However, the average number of tram OD passengers and its variance are significant factors in explaining the decrease in the number of tram OD passengers. Sensitivity analysis by using the estimated model during the period of study shows that a tram OD pair that originates in a suburban area and terminates in a city center tends to have a higher probability of survival, but a tram OD pair originating from a city center tends to have a lower probability of survival. The results of this study are fundamental materials for a discussion on which tram OD pairs should be considered by public transport authorities to maintain or increase the number of passengers. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cox hazard model; Number of OD passengers; Public transport; Smart card data, Rural areas; Sensitivity analysis; Smart cards; Hazard modeling; Lower probabilities; Number of OD passengers; Parameters estimated; Probability of survival; Public transport; Public transport authority; Public transport service; Railroad rolling stock",English,Article,258,4,Mobility and Transportation
7202693243,Personal mobility and climate change,2018,"Changing personal mobility behavior in response to climate change represents a major challenge for social scientists and practitioners, given the embedded nature of mobility in daily life. Attempts to understand, govern, and promote more sustainable mobility have tended to focus on individual decision making and incremental shifts in behavior, such as reduced car use and increased walking, cycling, and public transport use. Indeed, these are progressively being woven into narratives of “smart” travel and the use of technology to enhance individual decision making. In this review, I respond to these developments by arguing that researchers and practitioners need to reframe their understanding of personal mobility to consider how travel can also be understood as an embedded form of practice, intimately connected to historic, economic, and cultural influences. In so doing, I propose that researchers need to focus their attention on two major challenges that constitute underpinning obstacles for promoting long-term shifts in personal mobility: the ways in which cities are governed, designed, and regulated to promote hypermobility rather than dwelling; and the formidable problem of reducing personal carbon emissions from a growing international tourism industry. In addressing these two challenges, I argue for a new intellectual agenda that places personal well-being at the center of efforts to promote shifts toward low carbon mobility practices. Such (radical) shifts include reducing the demand for travel, an emphasis on dwelling, and the promotion of “active” travel and “slow tourism.” In short, I ask why we travel so much, and why we don't travel well.

The model, called GIS-LiDAR retrospective analysis, is implemented through territorial information tools in order to simulate and diagnose possible future imbalances based on past and current trends. This innovative methodology will be applied in a Spanish Mediterranean coastal area called the Campo de Cartagena, a territory with issues related to low-density urban sprawl, intensive agriculture and mass tourism coastal urbanization. This territory of high economic activity and with important environmental protected areas like the Mar Menor lagoon as well as complex interrelated phenomena will be “retrohistorically” diagnosed from the perspective of land transformation over 60 years.

There are further saving opportunities, but findings also highlight social practice complexities to navigate guests’ individual thermal comfort knowledge and daily routines. Transitions can be achieved through advanced smart services for direct and indirect customer feedback and host training.

The current challenges and barriers in the tourism sustainability, such as high energy use, extensive water consumption and habitat destruction, are first reviewed. Then the key cross-disciplinary elements in sustainable tourism, including green energy, green transportation, green buildings, green infrastructure, green agriculture and smart technologies, are discussed. To overcome the challenges and barriers, a few implementation strategies on achieving sustainable tourism from the aspects of policy/regulation, institution, finance, technology and culture are proposed, along with the framework and details of a key performance indicator system. Finally, prospects of the potential for tourism to contribute to the transformative changes, e.g., a green economy system, are illustrated.

In this paper, a multi-modal route choice model is proposed by incorporating ridesharing and public transit in a single-origin-destination (OD)-pair network. Due to the presence of ridesharing, travelers not only choose routes (including main road and side road), but also decide travel modes (including solo driver, ridesharing driver, ridesharing passenger, and transit passenger) to minimize travelers' generalized travel cost (not their actual travel cost due to the existence of car capacity constraints). The proposed model is expressed as an equivalent complementarity problem. Finally, the impacts of key factors on ridesharing behavior in numerical examples are discussed. The equilibrium results show that passengers' rewards and toll charge of solo drivers on main road significantly affect the travelers' route and mode choice behavior, and an increase of passengers' rewards (toll) motivates (forces) more travelers to take environmentally friendly travel modes. © 2018 by the authors.","Mode choice; Public transit; Ridesharing; Route choice; Sustainable transportation, complementarity; cost analysis; Internet; mobile phone; public transport; sustainability",English,Article,162,4,Mobility and Transportation

However, given the limited driving range and insufficient charging stations, searching and selecting charging stations is an important issue for EV drivers during trips. A smart charging service should be developed to help address the charging issue of EV drivers, and a practical algorithm for charging guidance is required to realise it. This study aims to design a geometry-based algorithm for charging guidance that can be effectively applied in the smart charging service. Geographic research findings and geometric approaches are applied to design the algorithm. The algorithm is practical because it is based on the information from drivers’ charging requests, and its total number of calculations is significantly less than that of the conventional shortest-first algorithm. The algorithm is effective because it considers the consistency of direction trend between the charging route and the destination in addition to the travel distance, which conforms to the travel demands of EV drivers. Moreover, simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. Results of the proposed algorithm are compared with those of the other two algorithms, which show that the proposed algorithm can obtain a better selection of charging stations for EV drivers from the perspective of entire travel chains and take a shorter computational time. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Charging guidance; Charging request; Electric vehicle; Geometry-based algorithm; Smart charging service, Electric vehicles; Geometry; Computational time; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Geometric approaches; Geometry-based algorithms; Provide guidances; Simulation example; Smart charging; algorithm; electric vehicle; geometry; travel demand; Charging (batteries)",English,Article,229,4,Mobility and Transportation

Nevertheless, although an ample number of standalone case studies have performed energy analyses in the hospitality industry, empirical studies focusing on exergy are scarce. Extending this line of research, the present study aims to exemplify the conduct of exergy analyses alongside energy ones in optimising environmental management intelligence and improving decision making processes in hospitality accommodation. In doing so, hotels located in international tourism destinations, where tourism has a significant economic impact on the respective countries’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP), participated in the study. Energy data from two hotels situated in the Dominican Republic and, from two hotel units located in Greece was collected and analysed in a comparative manner. Findings revealed that energy flows and energy efficiency alone are not sufficient for a comprehensive assessment of hotels’ energy profiles. Thus, it is suggested that corresponding exergy flows and efficiency rates should also be estimated along with the energy ones. This study infers that location and hotel star rating classification do not seem to be key parameters in assessing lodgings’ energy quality profiles, which suggests the need for further research. The practical implications for hotel managers are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Decision making; Efficiency; Environmental management; Exergy; Hotels; Comprehensive assessment; Decision making process; Empirical studies; Energy; Environmental profile; Gross domestic products; Hospitality industry; International tourisms; Energy efficiency, Efficiency; Energy; Environmental management; Exergy; Hospitality industry; Hotels",English,Article,213,11,Rural Resource Management

The number of small housing type-settlement development with no adequate garden or open space is always increase. Housing that lack of greenery has led to many problems such as bad quality of fresh air, lack of playing area for kids and mental problem. On the other side, the widespread of city development has resulted in reduced agricultural space which has led to inadequate domestic food supplies and the declining quality of food crops availability. In the wake of various issues on food and energy security, urban farming by Food Oriented Development (FOD) is a concept of urban development that can make the city as a food provider for its own citizens on an ongoing basis. This concept considers aspects of food security as well as socio-economic considerations in urban physical development. The objective of this research is to get the information of people preference of verticulture model as urban farming method in small housing type-settlement. The questionnaire survey using Likert scale is conducted to measure people perception and preference. This study explores factor analysis for decision-making process. The result indicate that people tend to choose simple and smart system of verticulture model as a vertical garden in private residential.

How urban planning contributes to the quality of life in cities is discussed using the example of Vienna, Austria. Picking Vienna for a discussion on livable cities provides a variety of inputs on the topic. Vienna has been voted the city with the highest quality of life in the Mercer Quality of Living Survey six times in a row. Moreover, the city ranks high in tourism and provides comprehensive services for its inhabitants, allowing a high quality of life in the city. Reasons that make the city livable are, among others, extensive green space, such as the River Danube and its local recreation areas, affordable housing provided, comprehensive social services, and much more. The aim of the city of Vienna is to be livable and to stay livable. Even though several achievements have been made, staying on top requires continuous effort; administrators work together with city politicians on strategies to keep Vienna livable. Therefore, various strategies and plans have been produced during the last year, which aim for high quality of life and identify steps in this direction. This chapter focuses on urban planning strategies and shows what urban planning can and has to contribute to a livable city. The city of Vienna grounds its work on livability on its own periodic survey, Quality of Life in Vienna. In 2013, the survey was undertaken for the fourth time (1995, 2003, 2008). Therefore, metrics, which are based on a solid foundation, characterize the quality of life of Vienna’s inhabitants. The study provides numbers for all city districts and consists of 140 questions asked to 8, 000 people. Viennese city planning uses the results of the study to define goals and strategies for the city’s development for the future. Current strategies are the Smart City Framework Strategy Wien and the Urban Development Plan 2025 (STEP 2025), which focus on urban planning instruments that help keep the city livable while dealing with challenges like population growth, lower financial resources, restrictions in respect to natural resource consumption, and so on. The key objective for 2050 in the Smart City Framework Strategy is the best quality of life for all inhabitants of Vienna, while minimizing the consumption of resources, which shall be realized through comprehensive innovation. The urban development plan aims at a true urban spirit, and its topics range from the further development of the existing city and questions related to land mobilization and business location policy, to networking within the metropolitan region, the planning of open space, and the transport system. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Fritz Wagner and Roger W.

The main objective of this research is to explore the influence of road network characteristics on the cyclist's path choice behaviour. The dataset used in this study consists of ∼27,500 GPS traces, which cyclists have recorded in Bologna, Italy, over a period of 4 weeks using a special smartphone application. Work trips are extracted from all traces by selecting only straight trips during the mornings of work days. After matching the traces to a specially prepared road map, the distributions of trip length, trip time and trip speed are determined. The shortest possible path between origin and destination of each trip is determined and compared with the chosen path. Results show that most cyclists tend to use the shortest path and accept only small detours. However, comparing the shortest path with the chosen path for each trip, it is possible to identify the network characteristics causing the cyclists to deviate from the shortest path. The main results of this study indicate that the chosen paths contain more cycleways and less intersections compared with the respective shortest paths. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018",", Graph theory; Roads and streets; Smartphones; Bologna , Italy; Network characteristics; Origin and destinations; Path choice; Road network; Shortest path; Smart-phone applications; Urban road networks; Traffic control",English,Conference paper,206,4,Mobility and Transportation
6507397477,"Free-Roaming Animals, Killing, and Suffering: The Case of African Elephants",2018,"The question of elephant “management”, presented here as epitomizing the conflicts of interests between human beings and free-ranging animals, is widely regarded as one of the more intractable problems on the African continent. Generally valued as magnificent and among the most intelligent members of the continent’s population of free-roaming animals, admired by Africans and foreign tourists alike, elephants are also considered to be among the most problematic in that they have a substantial impact on their environment. What makes the issue of “culling”—or “legal” (that is, government-controlled) killing for purposes of population management—different from cases of abuse and cruelty is that killing is characteristically seen to require justification, whether in terms of resources, health, welfare or interests. Such a defence, which is characteristically not forthcoming in instances of abuse and cruelty, may assume several forms, or combinations of the following considerations: cultural, scientific, economic, and/or moral. Confronting advocates of killing on their home territory, this chapter argues that—just as it is morally reprehensible as a means towards curbing human overpopulation and human environmental degradation—killing is impermissible in the case of non-human animals, especially in cases where these animals (in the present case, elephants) are relevantly similar to human beings. © The Author(s) 2018.",,English,Book chapter,203,3,Urban Sustainability

While these datasets include a large number of passenger trips in the network, they miss the socioeconomic attributes of passengers. Estimating the socioeconomic attributes from trip attributes is a way to enrich these datasets. To do so, Household Travel Survey (HTS) can be used to learn the relation between trips and socioeconomic attributes of passengers. This paper compares the performance of three well-known classifiers of Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine for estimating age and income of passengers in the public transit network using the HTS. The explanatory variables are considered as the start time of the trip, activity duration (time period between two consecutive trips), land use around the origin, and land use around the destination of trips. The target variables are age and income of passengers. HTS data, which include both explanatory and target variables, are used to train and validate the classifiers. Three measures including Accuracy, F-score, and Informedness are used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Also, the three classifiers are compared to a random classifier. The case study is the HTS from the South East Queensland (SEQ) between 2009 and 2012. Results show that the Naïve Bayes classifier is a better classifier for estimating the age and income of passengers from trip attributes. © 2018 ATRF, Commonwealth of Australia.

56443770100; 26429665700; 7101974379,Application of smart card data in validating a large-scale multi-modal transit assignment model,2018,"The accuracy of transit assignment plays an important role in the successful design and operation of a transit system. The majority of previous studies on validating transit assignment models has used limited survey data or has lacked a large-scale multimodal and high quality dataset. Considering the advantages of smart card [automatic fare collection (AFC)] systems, the aims of this study are to put forward a methodological framework to validate existing transit assignment models and to quantify the performance of these models. Our study combines data from three sources: the General Transit Feed Specification, an AFC system, and a strategic transport model from a large-scale multimodal public transport network, namely the South-East Queensland (SEQ) network in Australia. The AFC system in SEQ has provided a very large and highly accurate dataset on passenger boardings and alightings for the three transit modes of bus, rail and ferry. Following a data analysis, an origin–destination trip matrix is estimated for the AM peak period using AFC data as an input to the transit assignment model. Then, the results of the transit assignment model are compared with the actual passengers’ route choices over the same period, at different levels of aggregation. The model performance is quantified by each route (and direction), by each segment of each route (and direction), and by each stop. The results indicate that relatively tighter thresholds are required to validate the transit assignment at the segment level than at the stop level. Furthermore, the validation results indicate that the greatest error is realized for the bus mode, while the level of accuracy in the rail mode is the best. The results suggest a segment-level analysis should be used as the most useful level of aggregation for future calibration and validation of transit assignment models. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Automatic fare collection system; Model validation; Smart card; Transit assignment, Mass transportation; Transportation routes; Design and operations; Fare collections; Future calibration; Methodological frameworks; Model validation; Public transport networks; Transit assignment; Validation results; Smart cards",English,Article,298,4,Mobility and Transportation

A new methodology has been developed, using SQL software based on the trip chain model, to create an OD matrix for Adelaide's public transport users, and from it to estimate the demand for the transit system. The methodology used assumes that passengers' alighting points can be determined from the next boarding stop using the Euclidian distance, and considering the minimum walking distance. Developing approaches for evaluating accurate Origin Destination OD matrices from smart card data is useful for transit planners. The knowledge of travel demand will facilitate the design of appropriate public transport routes; which leads to the optimisation of schedules, which can improve the performance of public transport system and in turn increase patronage. © 2018 Transportation Systems in the Connected Era - Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference of Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies, HKSTS 2018.

If the aim is to modify large areas (regions/territories), the problem becomes significantly harder. Contrary to what might be expected, combining N smart cities within the same territory will not necessarily lead to a smart region. Although there are several smart-region experiments of an international nature, there is still no benchmark to facilitate this task.

56263320300; 6506091968,Wind characterization in Taranto city as a basis for innovative sustainable urban development,2018,"The city of Taranto, in the south-east of Italy, is experiencing a transition from one of the most polluted and industrialized area characterized by the presence of the largest integrated steelworks in Europe, to a center of attractions of investments in innovation on sustainability and tourism. Among sustainability projects, urban wind energy is emerging as a technology useful in diffusion of smart grids for energetic sustainable development and also an interesting growing niche market in which there could be new investment opportunities. Numerous projects aimed at developing wind energy production are under constructions and wind characteristics and power potential of various sites have been studied in many Mediterranean countries. The urban wind analysis may represent a new tool to complete local wind atlases including the built environment, to evaluate changes that weathering may cause in the physical and architectural state of buildings, and to analyze the dispersion of pollutants from sources to receptor sites. In this paper, an analysis of wind potential and characteristics in Taranto, Apulia, a north Jonian urban site in Italy, has been performed by using high time resolved (10 min) meteorological data collected over a time span of two years, in the aim to describe the numerical procedures adopted to perform fitting of wind speed data without using special software. This urban site, in the first year of investigation from May 1st, 2009 to April 30th, 2010, was subjected to main wind regimes that come mostly from N with 12.27% and SSW with 9.89% of total hours; the calm occurred with a frequency of 10.94%. In the second year, from May 1st, 2010 to April 30th, 2011, the winds also blown predominantly from N with 12.56% of the total annual hours, and SSW with 9.33%, while the calms reached 11.08%. Dispersion of pollutants emitted from various sources among cement factory, a quarry/landfill, a refinery and the steelworks, poses serious health risks to population mainly resident downwind the prevalent wind directions. Simply computed mean wind speeds had values of 1.84 (sd = 0.26 m/s) in the first year and 1.90 m/s (sd = 0.30 m/s) in the second year under investigation. Weibull's k values, measuring the wind potential of the site, were higher during the spring-summer warmest months and lower during the autumn-winter; the lowest appeared in November 2009 (0.639) the highest in June 2010 (1.665). Mean yearly values of k were 1.210 (sd = 0.18) in the first year and 1.065 (sd = 0.24) in the second year of the study, the correlation between the monthly values of k in the years under consideration was R2 = 0.59 (p = 0.043) indicating that although variations occurred, the wind potential remain partly unaltered from one year to the other examined. LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) for the wind turbines chosen among the 35 ones listed in the “Catalogue of European Urban Wind Turbine Manufactures”, excluding those with rated power below 0.1 kW, ranged from 0.12 to 10.6 €/kWh and differs slightly in the two years examined. The values were competitive with some off-shore and on-shore installations, biogas and photovoltaic, but it does not consider pollution costs and subsidies. The proposed solution was economically viable, also by considering the possible integration in a hybrid photovoltaic-wind system, or fossil-based heat generator system supplemented by solar photovoltaic and wind energy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Costs; Distribution functions; Economics; Health risks; Investments; Meteorology; Pollution; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Steel; Steel construction; Sustainable development; Weibull distribution; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Investment opportunities; Levelized cost of electricities; Mediterranean countries; Sustainability project; Sustainable urban development; Taranto; Urban development; Wind energy production; Urban growth, Levelized cost of electricity; Sustainability; Taranto; Urban development; Urban wind turbine; Weibull distribution function",English,Article,554,3,Urban Sustainability

The case of Lille “EuraFlandres” interchange,2018,"Introduction: The importance of the transport infrastructure role is often described in the attempt to describe the characteristics of a “smart city”. Good planning and organization of communication networks contributes to the development of cities that are more fluid and user-friendly and sustainable, concepts underlying “smart cities”. The paper focuses on the impact on social organisation and on conception of transport intermodal infrastructures such as city-hubs inducing new and smarter practices of transport infrastructure, but also the urban dimension and their insertion through the actual city and, even more, by the creation of an entirely new neighbourhood and the preoccupation of a better quality of life. As part of the European research project FP7 “City-HUB”, 27 interchanges have been studied in nine European countries. The paper emphases on the implementation of the City-HUB interchange typology to the case study of Lille European Metropolis (MEL) where two contingent railway stations, Lille Flandres and Lille Europe, were analysed as a potential unique interchange named “Euraflandres”with socio-economic impacts and the possibility that it may become a “place” of life in the smart city. Methods: Within the FP7 project City-HUB a literature review was conducted on the role and characteristics of interchanges in the cities and their contribution to smart cities [29]. For 27 interchanges in nine European countries, we have determined a number of relationships between these transport multimodal interchanges and their environment, and established a typology capturing different interchanges and a scheme for scoring their characteristics in terms of function and logistic dimensions (demand, number of transport modes, services and facilities, location in the city) and their local constraints. The governance framework was specified through carrying out semi-structured interviews with key interchange actors for each City-HUB case study that also questioned about the role of interchanges in local economies and their potential impact on that. The Lille Flandres and Lille Europe as a unique landmark “Euraflandres” were particularly studied to understand their characteristics and role to contribute to a smarter city. Results: Based on the City-HUB typology, the “Euraflandres” gets a score of 9 because its demand is higher than 120,000 in daily passengers, includes 13 public and private transport modes (several PT, long distance coaches, car and bike), is located in the city centre and is included into a local plan of urban development and TOD definition. “Euraflandres” has all the characteristics for becoming an urban Landmark for the city of Lille. We show how this interchange gets a higher role for being a node on the international railway network, and how their inside and outside spatial and functioning reorganisation contribute to ease the use of public transport for travellers by introducing ITS, innovations in ticketing and providing new urban characteristics transforming transport infrastructures into new places to live. Conclusions: Linking the smart city and the development made with “Euraflandres”, we have seen that an opportunity exists to join together the two Lille railway stations and urban Public Transport interchanges in order to combine a great urban interchange. It will procure advantages for increasing the accessibility for all destinations at urban Lille metropolis and regional level, but also at the national and international levels by the possibility offered by the French TGVs running on national network and the Railteam high speed trains such as Eurostar and Thalys. Each type of interchange, according to the identified functions and local constraints, should require the involvement of different stakeholders interchanges and the Lille City-HUB management with its stakeholders’ committees seems to be oriented to make effort for finding an agreed way for reducing conflicts, in order to better plan outcomes and to allow communities to have an influence over the future shape of the places where they live. The community-led participation is the first step to identify requirements and needs of operators (i.e. transport activities including services and facilities) and of users who will perceive the City-HUB as a transport node and a place where to have access to their mobility mode and where to carry out some other activities during their waiting time. Despite existing barriers (complex governance framework, physical barriers, functions and logistics to revise, local constraints), all the stakeholders are willing to improve the visibility and the functionality of these interchanges. “Euraflandres” has the role of developing activities and regenerating the urban environment, by transforming the surrounding area features. All this will make cities more convivial and fluid, answering to two key aspects of the Smart City, when we follow the definition of the smart city as a “fluid”, “intelligent” and “convivial” city by [4]. The extension of the Euralille neighbourhood where is located “Euraflandres”, is part of the Lille urban regeneration, still under construction, will provide new housing and also social housing for low income people and new city amenities transforming it in a new place to live transforming the current two separated interchange towards the future one landmark interchange with a higher share of sustainable and affordable public transport modes share. © 2017, The Author(s).","Advanced public transportation systems; Economic and social effects; Economics; Housing; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Interchanges; Mass transportation; Railroad cars; Railroad stations; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Sustainable development; Transportation; Urban growth; Urban planning; Urban transportation; City-hubs; Euraflandres; Multi-modal; Socio-economic impacts; Stakeholder involvement; Smart city, City-hubs; Euraflandres; Multimodal interchanges; Smart cities; Socio-economic impacts; Stakeholder involvement; Urban planning",English,Article,826,3,Urban Sustainability

It is only recently, though, with concerns over climate change, pollution, congestion, and obesity among others, that have cities throughout the world have begun to implement policies to promote cycling. In Greece, however, the use of the bicycle is limited. In Preveza, a small touristic city in Northwestern Greece where the use of the bicycle is prominent when compared to other Greek cities, there are efforts to promote cycling. Through the aid of a structured questionnaire, the residents evaluated the suitability of the city for cycling, the existing infrastructure, appropriate education, and behavior of cyclists and drivers. More than half of the residents use bicycles as their transportation and stated that bicycles are an inexpensive way of transport in the city and had the opinion that the state should encourage bicycle use by supporting subvention in bicycle acquisition. Two-thirds of the residents evaluated the cycling facilities of their city as adequate, but unsafe for young cyclists who do not follow the rules of transport. Adult cyclists, in contrast, were more loyal to the code, but stated that drivers did not respect their presence on the roads. This research provides important information on the perceived shortcomings of cycling as a transport mode in Preveza that may be of interest to towns/cities with similar characteristics. © 2018 by the authors.","Cycling infrastructure; Cyclists' behavior; Residents' views; Slow city; Transportation modes, Epirus; Greece; Preveza; environmental policy; field of view; infrastructure planning; resident population; tourist behavior; transport vehicle; transportation development; transportation mode",English,Article,241,4,Mobility and Transportation

We discuss findings from empirical research with a rural community on Bruny Island, Australia, where a 3-year research project (2016–19) – CONSORT – funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), is underway with approximately 35 householders trialing a new residential battery storage and photovoltaic energy system. Bruny Island has a problem of peak demand for electricity during tourist periods, and a back-up diesel generator is currently used to supply electricity during peaks. An alternative solution is being trialled through CONSORT: household-level battery storage, which can be drawn upon by the utility to supply the grid as required. In this paper we explore two energy geography issues: first, how global and national energy challenges are manifesting on Bruny Island through the CONSORT project, and, second, the ways in which the particular sociotechnical context of Bruny Island has influenced the CONSORT project, creating tensions as well as opening up opportunities for energy innovation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",", Battery storage; Experiments; Living labs; Rural innovation; Smart grid",English,Article,185,11,Rural Resource Management

We collected the surnames of 19th century Sardinian populations through the Status Animarum (parish censuses). The structures of past populations were compared with current structures based on surnames reported in telephone directories. The lowland villages studied have been the final destination of transhumance and have a different historical, cultural and economic background. The spread of surnames in Sardinia may have occurred also by means of transhumance which took place every year along precise routes from the pastoral mountain zones to the agricultural plains. The standardized index of Chen and Cavalli-Sforza was used to calculate relationships among the five villages of Barbagia di Belvì (Aritzo, Belvì Desulo, Gadoni and Tonara). An application of non-metric multidimensional scaling to the isonymy matrices showed that the villages of Barbagia di Belvì form a group that have changed very little over time. Transhumance routes were studied by spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) applied to surnames. The results suggest that there has been an appreciable admixture between the Sardinian populations of the mountain villages of the central areas and the populations of southern lowland villages. Riassunto Nel presente lavoro sono state esaminate le relazioni tra le popolazioni sarde attraverso l'analisi dei cognomi in cinque comuni della zona storico-geografica della Barbagia di Belvì (Aritzo, Belvì Desulo, Gadoni e Tonara), area montuosa tradizionalmente dedita all'allevamento delle pecore e punto di partenza della transumanza verso zone di pianura. I cognomi della popolazione sono stati rilevati dai registri parrocchiali (Status Animarum) del XIX secolo. La struttura cognominale di questo periodo è stata confrontata con quella attuale, ricavata dallo studio dei cognomi riportati negli elenchi telefonici, dei comuni di pianura, transito e destinazione finale della transumanza, che hanno un differente fondo storico, culturale ed economico. La diffusione dei cognomi in Sardegna, infatti, potrebbe essere avvenuta anche attraverso la transumanza, che si verifica ogni anno lungo percorsi precisi dalle zone montane pastorali alle pianure dedite all'agricoltura. È stato utilizzato l'indice standardizzato di Chen e Cavalli-Sforza per calcolare le relazioni tra i cinque comuni della Barbagia di Belvì. L'applicazione del non-metric multidimensional scaling alle matrici di isonimia ha mostrato che questi comuni formano un gruppo che è cambiato molto poco nel tempo. Le direttrici di transumanza sono state studiate mediante la spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) applicata ai cognomi. I risultati suggeriscono che vi è stata un'apprezzabile commistione tra le popolazioni sarde dei comuni di montagna delle aree centrali e quelle dei comuni della pianura meridionale. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH",", 19th Century; History, 21st Century; Human Migration; Humans; Italy; Male; Names; Population Dynamics; agriculture; altitude; female; history; human; Italy; male; migration; nomenclature; population dynamics; statistics and numerical data, Agriculture; Altitude; Female; History",English,Article,448,3,Urban Sustainability

57190276677; 7006887002,Dynamic autonomous vehicle fleet operations: Optimization-based strategies to assign AVs to immediate traveler demand requests,2018,"Motivated by the growth of ridesourcing services and the expected advent of fully-autonomous vehicles (AVs), this paper defines, models, and compares assignment strategies for a shared-use AV mobility service (SAMS). Specifically, the paper presents the on-demand SAMS with no shared rides, defined as a fleet of AVs, controlled by a central operator, that provides direct origin-to-destination service to travelers who request rides via a mobile application and expect to be picked up within a few minutes. The underlying operational problem associated with the on-demand SAMS with no shared rides is a sequential (i.e. dynamic or time-dependent) stochastic control problem. The AV fleet operator must assign AVs to open traveler requests in real-time as traveler requests enter the system dynamically and stochastically. As there is likely no optimal policy for this sequential stochastic control problem, this paper presents and compares six AV-traveler assignment strategies (i.e. control policies). An agent-based simulation tool is employed to model the dynamic system of AVs, travelers, and the intelligent SAMS fleet operator, as well as, to compare assignment strategies across various scenarios. The results show that optimization-based AV-traveler assignment strategies, strategies that allow en-route pickup AVs to be diverted to new traveler requests, and strategies that incorporate en-route drop-off AVs in the assignment problem, reduce fleet miles and decrease traveler wait times. The more-sophisticated AV-traveler assignment strategies significantly improve operational efficiency when fleet utilization is high (e.g. during the morning or evening peak); conversely, when fleet utilization is low, simply assigning traveler requests sequentially to the nearest idle AV is comparable to more-advanced strategies. Simulation results also indicate that the spatial distribution of traveler requests significantly impacts the empty fleet miles generated by the on-demand SAMS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based simulation; Assignment problem; Autonomous vehicles; Dynamic vehicle routing; Fleet management; Mobility service, Autonomous agents; Autonomous vehicles; Combinatorial optimization; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Vehicle routing; Agent based simulation; Assignment problems; Dynamic Vehicle Routing; Fleet management; Mobility service; management; numerical model; optimization; routing; travel demand; unmanned vehicle; Fleet operations",English,Article,284,4,Mobility and Transportation

Therefore, many challenges have appeared in cities all over the world related to growth, over- population, urban planning, quality of services, competitiveness, environmental factors and citizenship values, which have become main priorities of the managers and mayors of these cities. The Smart City concept emerges as a paradigm that aims to solve these problems and challenges, by developing policies, infrastructure, ser- vices and public awareness programs that will transform today cities, for example a future self-sustaining innovation, growth, technological development, civic and ethical citizenship and social progress. This study presents an exploratory analysis in respect of the current global situation related to the concept of Smart City, com- paring the different essential definitions and dimensions described in recent litera- ture by cited authors and related to the nomenclature of the term. The effects, challenges and opportunities that Smart Cities can offer to their citizens, has been presented, for example in different programs, projects and initiatives, that cities all over the world have implemented, focusing on sustainable social innovations, eco- nomic growth, environmental protection, quality of life, participatory governance, social and community development, citizenship education, efficient urban mobility, tourism services, health and safety. The situation in Bogota and Medellin, the two main cities of Colombia have been reviewed and studied in this work, the aspects previously mentioned have been taken into account to establish a new definition of the Smart City concept. To perform this task, a set of six dimensions and 27 subcat- egories are essential to define and measure this concept in the Colombian paradigm, which can be used to monitor the current status, in order to approximate evaluations of Colombian cities to the qualification concept described as the Smart City. Due to the lack of studies observed in this work, further research must be focused, not only on getting more data from Bogota and Medellin, but also having the opportunity to observe the situation in other important cities such as Barranquilla, Cali, Bucaramanga or Cartagena, currently no data is available. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

These dynamic tariffs could promote water use efficiency by reflecting the variations of water demand, availability, and delivery costs over time. This paper relates the potential benefits of dynamic water tariffs, at the utility and basin scale, to their design across a range of timescales. On one end of the spectrum, subdaily peak pricing shifts use away from peak hours to lower a utility's operational and capital expenses. On the other end, scarcity pricing factors in the variations of the marginal opportunity cost of water at weekly or longer timescales in the river basin from which water is withdrawn. Dynamic pricing schemes that act across timescales can be devised to yield both types of benefits. The analysis estimates these benefits separately for Greater London (United Kingdom) and its 15 million inhabitants. Scarcity pricing implemented on a weekly timescale equates the marginal cost of residential water with estimates of the marginal economic values of environmental-recreational flows derived from tourism, property values, etc. Scarcity pricing during droughts could result in a 22-63% average reduction in environmental flow shortage while residential price increases would be capped at 150% of base levels. Yet, its ability to protect environmental flows could decrease in extreme shortage situations. The net present value of savings from peak pricing is conservatively evaluated at approximately £10 million for each initial percentage point in daily peak-hour price increase. © ASCE.",", England; London [England]; United Kingdom; Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Housing; Water supply; Watersheds; Demand management strategies; Dynamic pricing; Environmental flow; Net present value; Opportunity costs; Percentage points; Potential benefits; Water use efficiency; assessment method; demand-side management; pricing policy; river basin; water demand; water industry; Costs",English,Article,264,11,Rural Resource Management

With the development of ICT technologies, tourism “big data” such as geographic data, tourist attractions evaluation data, tourist service data and related traffic information, becomes available to access, which provides great opportunities to develop intelligent tourism decision support systems (TDSS) for related government policy making. To effectively divide tourism agglomeration areas to support tourism-planning decision, by use of the “big data” resources, a fuzzy adaptive minimum spanning tree (F-AMST) model, which integrates adaptive minimum spanning tree (AMST) method and fuzzy level evaluation method, is proposed in this study. The F-AMST model consists of three parts: F-MST generation, F-MST splitting, and clustering solution evaluation and adjustment. The proposed model is then applied to cluster 142 A-level scenic spots in mountain areas of Hebei province, China, and the optimal tourism clustering solution with seven tourism agglomeration areas is finally obtained. The result is then analysed from the following aspects: the spatial agglomeration degree of each tourism agglomeration area is analysed by use of the fuzzy dense degree based on F-AMST model; the spatial distribution type of scenic spot nodes within each agglomeration area is analysed by using the nearest neighbour index R with consideration of spatial distance factors; the scenic spot node level system of each agglomeration area is analysed by use of the node level perfection index Z considering the scenic spot node level factor; the influences of the two factors, the spatial distance and the scenic spot node level, to the agglomeration degree are then analysed by use of the correlation between R and fuzzy dense degree and that between Z and fuzzy dense degree respectively. The findings are carefully described in this paper and the results can directly support government's decision making in tourism resources planning and construction of tourism agglomeration areas so as to improve the regional tourism competitiveness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive minimum spanning tree; Clustering; Decision making; Fuzzy systems; Tourism source management, Agglomeration; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cluster analysis; Decision support systems; Fuzzy systems; Public policy; Trees (mathematics); Agglomeration degrees; Clustering; Clustering solutions; Decision making in tourisms; Minimum spanning trees; Planning and development; Source management; Tourist attractions; Decision making",English,Article,326,11,Rural Resource Management

To estimate travel demand, the origin–destination matrix is required, which must be estimated from commuters’ trajectories in multi-leg journeys. To infer a destination from alighting stops requires the ability to distinguish between transfer and activity and to improve the accuracy of detecting short or hidden activities. In this paper, a new heuristic method has been developed using SQL software based on the trip chain model for bus passengers in Adelaide, using smart card information. This study uses some assumptions and develops a technique to differentiate a transfer from an activity. By this method, it is assumed that ‘if a passenger alights, then later boards another bus on the same or a parallel route, it is assumed that the passenger was not transferring but was undertaking some activity between the trip legs. Analysis of a week’s data for bus users validated based on a survey. The result is useful in estimating the Origin–Destination (OD) matrix and assists in reaching an accurate estimation of public transport demand; the OD matrix will help public agencies to rationalise routes, leading to higher public transport patronage. © 2018 ATRF, Commonwealth of Australia.

The advent of smart specialisation, which focuses on regional diversification across sectors, offers considerable and hitherto largely unrealized potential for developing innovative tourism policies within this new agenda. This paper addresses the understudied concept of tourism diversification and its unrealized relevance to smart specialisation, which has emerged as amainstream logic underpinning EU Cohesion Policy reforms and has diffused into other OECD countries. It provides a theoretical framework for studying product, market, sectoral and regional diversification as well as related variety in tourism.

However they require route choice set as an input. In this paper we propose a method to determine that automatically. Firstly, we find the K shortest routes. Secondly, we set cut-off criteria to find the reasonable routes, by comparing the invehicle, wait and access egress interchange (AEI) cost of each route with the shortest route's. We work with 7 origin destination (OD) pairs of the London Underground for which more routes were surveyed. Among them 5 of them had similar properties and from that it resulted that a route is considered reasonable, if its cost components are up to 1.71, 1.45 and 1.26 times the shortest route's respectively. From the 2 outliers we understood that we need to include OD specific attributes when setting cut-offs: route with minimum interchange and lines available at origin and destination. © 2018 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

However, impaired water quality because of fecal pollution poses a potential threat to the tourists' health. This study probabilistically characterized the health risks associated with recreational swimming engendered by waterborne enterococci at 13 Taiwanese beaches by using quantitative microbial risk assessment. First, data on enterococci concentrations at coastal beaches monitored by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration were reproduced using nonparametric Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The ingestion volumes of recreational swimming based on uniform and gamma distributions were subsequently determined using MCS. Finally, after the distribution combination of the two parameters, the beta-Poisson dose-response function was employed to quantitatively estimate health risks to recreational swimmers. Moreover, various levels of risk to recreational swimmers were classified and spatially mapped to explore feasible recreational and environmental management strategies at the beaches. The study results revealed that although the health risks associated with recreational swimming did not exceed an acceptable benchmark of 0.019 illnesses daily at all beaches, they approached to this benchmark at certain beaches. Beaches with relatively high risks are located in Northwestern Taiwan owing to the current movements. © IWA Publishing 2018.","Bathing Beaches; Enterococcus; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Recreation; Risk Assessment; Swimming; Taiwan; Water Microbiology; Taiwan; Beaches; Environmental management; Health; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Poisson distribution; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Water pollution; Water quality; Coastal beaches; Enterococcus; Fecal pollution; Impaired water; Monte Carlo's simulation; Potential threats; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Swimming; Swimming activity; Tourist health; bacterium; benchmarking; dose-response relationship; environmental management; groundwater; health impact; health risk; microbial activity; Monte Carlo analysis; public health; recreational activity; risk assessment; swimming; water quality; article; dose response; environmental management; environmental protection; health hazard; human; ingestion; Monte Carlo method; risk assessment; seashore; swimming; Taiwan; Enterococcus; environmental monitoring; feces; isolation and purification; microbiology; Monte Carlo method; procedures; recreation; risk assessment; standards; swimming; Health risks, Beach; Enterococci; Monte Carlo simulation; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Swimming",English,Article,202,3,Urban Sustainability

57208109695,Intelligence and innovation for city tourism sustainability,2018,"For decades, tourism sustainability in cities meant just economic growth. Destination managers, local authorities and industry leaders focused their concerns on promotion and commercial activities, strongly convinced that cities would admit a steady, almost unlimited growth of visitors. Thus, according to statistics in Europe, city tourism growth indexes have overcome traditional leisure tourism, getting more attention from governments as a fairly harmless recipe for struggling against social and economic crisis. However, the complexity of urban communities together with unexpected, uncontrolled travel patterns is unveiling important conflicts and impacts of such city tourism blooming. In recent years, many destinations have suddenly been awakened from the tourism dream by their own local communities and media. Unexpectedly, the traditional welcoming atmosphere has turned into rejection and hostile attitudes. As a result, sustainability is compromised. Therefore, future city tourism sustainability will require a new approach. Social and environmental impacts must be seriously considered in tourism planning, in order to achieve economic sustainability. Developing urban destinations must learn from those where such sustainability is nowadays under risk; they will eventually have to face the same problems. The aim of this chapter is to identify—from the experience of practitioners—how some leading tourist cities are being affected at different scale by new impacts and what strategies are being implemented to cope with them. Size matters, of course, but the benchmarking applied in tourism planning by the author demonstrates that there are common patterns that may be considered by any destination managers as useful guidelines for planning in any city. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",", Impacts; Sustainability; Tourism cities; Urban communities",English,Book chapter,262,3,Urban Sustainability

This is, for example, the case for the intensively touristic exploitation of the most popular destinations or the abandonment of marginal areas due to the concentration of the population in urban areas. Mountainous areas are rich in the natural and cultural values, which provide long-term benefits also to cities and towns, but they are particularly vulnerable and sometimes inhospitable. The survival chances of vital communities in marginal mountainous territories depend on a developmental approach that considers how to handle economic growth, environmental conservation, identity and cultural issues, as well as enhancing the endogenous potential in a common way. This contribution presents the results of an exemplary strategic plan for Seren del Grappa, a small village located in the northeastern Italian Alps. The definition of a shared vision and strategic guidelines for the future of the territory, up to the implementation of the first concrete projects, were developed through a participatory process involving the local population, the administrators and the economic operators. Moreover, the article includes a description of the applied methodology, as well as a discussion of essential prerequisites, successes and weaknesses of the process.

The transfer from one carrier to another, in an interchange node such as a port, a rail station, a logistics terminal, often implicates an increase of monetary and temporal costs, connected to material and immaterial operations. The principal aim is to minimize the overall cost of transport, but the freight interchange node can represent critical steps in logistics chain and for this reason much attention is now committed to actions to make efficient the functional organization of the terminal. In the last years an increasing interest is directed to the use of vehicles technologically advanced with automation of functions. The paper focuses on a particular technology, conceived recently, otherwise an intelligent rail wagon called AGW (Automated Guided Wagon) for handling of containers in a port. The use of intelligent system AGW as handling unit of containers in the yard, would allow the overcoming of diseconomies of scale and the reduction of the handling times and costs through a flexible management in relation to the characteristics of the transport supply and demand, the latter subject to a high variability. In the paper, after a brief description of the AGW technology and the advantages connected to the use of this handling system in a freight interchange node, the attention is focused on a comparative analysis between the handling system now operating in the container port (RTG, Straddle Carrier, AVG, etc.) and the system that involves the use of AGW. This analysis is made on the operational characteristics of the different handling systems, through the use of: functional schemes, with the aim to carry out evaluations related to the spatial, organizational and relational structure of container yard equipped with different handling unit; network models (graphical representation of links and paths; basic cost parameters) for the schematization and simulation of container handling in the yard; cost models for quantitative evaluation of monetary and temporal impacts, that derive from the use of different handling unit in the yard. © 2018 The Authors.

Whereas most estimations of demand are made by analyzing transit orientations or destinations of unchained transits. However, organization of bus or metro routes compels riders to make a lot of unnecessary transfers, and the transfer points are neither reflective of population’s actual orientations nor of their destinations. Aims and Objectives: The objective of this paper is to improve estimations of population demand by identifying transfer activities of riders using public transportation. Durations and displacements of transit chaining breaks are to be check in judging the transfer activities. Boarding stops for making transfers are ruled out as transportation demand estimation. The effectiveness of the new approach entailing the use of transit chaining breaks is also to be evaluated based on the calculation of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients for assessing the correlation between transportation estimation and population distribution. Result and Conclusion: Durations and displacements of transit chaining breaks could be used to identify transfer activities. The use of the transit chaining approach reduces the occurrence of false demand, resulting in the estimation being more objective in relation to the population. The results of the study indicated that the inclusion of transit chaining breaks leads to more accurate estimations of public transport demand within a population. © 2018 Haitao et al.",", Population equity; Public transport; Smart card data; Transit chaining breaks; Transport demand estimation; Urban transportation",English,Article,228,4,Mobility and Transportation

Hence, the widely used intelligent water drops algorithm is implemented as MapReduce model using Hadoop environment to compute the shortest path for speedy delivery of goods. A front end is designed to carry out interstate and intrastate transportation of items. Distance matrix comprising 50, 100, 150.500 cities is considered for the simulation. From the experiment, it is observed that the intelligent water drops algorithm implemented in MapReduce model meets the objective of delivering materials to the right destination in minimum time. The performance of the proposed MapReduce intelligent water drops algorithm is compared with other popular algorithms like Bellman-Ford algorithm, Thorup algorithm, Gobow algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm. It is observed that the proposed MapReduce intelligent water drops algorithm gives a reliable shortest path between any source and destination city with less CPU time than the other algorithms.

However, passenger travel patterns can only be watched through a period time, and a lot of people travel by public transportation in big cities like Beijing daily, which leads to large-scale data and difficult operation. Using SPARK platform, this paper proposes a trip reconstruction algorithm and adopts the density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to mine the travel patterns of each Smart Card (SC) user in Beijing. For the phenomenon that passengers swipe cards before arriving to avoid the crowd caused by the people of the same destination, the algorithm based on passenger travel frequent items is adopted to guarantee the accuracy of spatial regular patterns. At last, this paper puts forward a model based on density and node importance to gather bus stations. The transportation connection between areas formed by these bus stations can be seen with the help of SC data.

Researchers can use public accessible geo-tagged photos to map and analyze hotspots and tourist activities in various tourist attractions. This research studies geo-tagged Flickr photos collected from the Grand Canyon area within 12 months (2014/12/01–2015/11/30) using kernel density estimate (KDE) mapping, Exif (Exchangeable image file format) data, and dynamic time warping (DTW) methods. Different spatiotemporal movement patterns of tourists and popular points of interests (POIs) in the Grand Canyon area are identified and visualized in GIS maps. The frequency of Flickr’s monthly photos is similar (but not identical) to the actual tourist total numbers in the Grand Canyon. We found that winter tourists in the Grand Canyon explore fewer POIs comparing to summer tourists based on their Flickr data. Tourists using high-end cameras are more active and explore more POIs than tourists using smart phones photos. Weekend tourists are more likely to stay around the lodge area comparing to weekday tourists who have visited more remote areas in the park, such as the north of Pima Point. These tourist activities and spatiotemporal patterns can be used for the improvement of national park facility management, regional tourism, and local transportation plans. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Flickr; Geo-tagged photos; Grand Canyon; Hotspot analysis; Spatiotemporal; Tourism, Image analysis; Location; Location based services; Office buildings; Parks; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Flickr; Geo-tagged photo; Grand Canyons; Hotspot analyse; Hotspots; Location based; Photo sharing; Spatiotemporal; Tourist activities; Tourist behavior; Mapping",English,Conference paper,219,3,Urban Sustainability

""one-ticket-transfer"" smartcards in China can only record spatiotemporal information of origin and destination (OD) without path, therefore, it is hard to identify whether the fail-to-board (FtB) passengers are traveling backward or just waiting at the platform. To identify the phenomenon of ""traveling backward"" and its share of passenger flow, we use affinity the propagation (AP) method under the between-within-proportion (BWP) index to cluster automatic fare collection (AFC) data with single-path OD; and carry on a field research to verify the proposed method. We also establish a virtual path to rationally assign these ""traveling backward"" passengers to the network, which will reflect more actual passenger flows distribution and give advice for overcrowded URT network management. © 2017 ASCE.","Affinity propagation clustering; Fail to board; Overcrowding; Travel backwards; Urban rail transit, Smart cards; Affinity propagation clustering; Fail to board; Overcrowding; Travel backwards; Urban rail transit; Light rail transit",English,Conference paper,162,4,Mobility and Transportation

In this paper, we develop a straightforward method to identify group travel behavior (GTB), defined as two or more persons intentionally traveling together from a single origin to a single destination, with public transit smart card data based on proxemics theory. We apply our method to Beijing to reveal the patterns of GTB, using all records generated by the subway system during a one-week period in 2010. Our data and method do not allow a reliable estimate of GTB share in overall travel, but do enable a description of the characteristics and the spatiotemporal pattern of GTB. The results reveal that the group size and GTB frequency follow a long tail distribution: far more people travel in small groups than in large groups and far more group travelers can be observed carrying out only one group trip than travelers making multiple group trips. Group trips tend to occur in weekends, in afternoons, and during public holidays. Furthermore, stations and lines serving leisure destinations show the highest GTB scores. We conclude that the GTB pattern is distinctly different from the pattern of individual travel in terms of both time and space, and is essentially influenced by urban land uses surrounding subway stations. © 2017 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies",", Beijing; Group travel behavior; Identification; Proxemics; Smart card data",English,Article,228,4,Mobility and Transportation

Data and information related to migrations is used not only for statistical, humanitarian, medical, public security, and other similar purposes, but are also especially used for purposes concerning national security. In the midst of migrants seeking international help and humanitarian aid, members of organized crime, human, drugs, and weapons traffickers, terrorists, and other criminals/deviants could potentially be hiding amongst those seeking refuge. Their purpose is to clandestinely reaching their destination where criminal offences, terrorism and other similar activities can inflict serious damage to national or international security. During the last few years, the rising inflow of refugees and economic migrants is becoming a more and more serious economic, political and security problem for Europe, especially for the member countries of the European Union. In 2015, the migrant inflow into Europe was above one million, which is the most exceptional influx to date, and policymakers do not have a competent answer of how to react. To make things even worse, Turkey is threatening to push an enormous number of additional migrants into the Greek islands. Additional controversy is present in the Schengen area, which will probably narrow - not expand - the so-called Dublin Declaration, in European countries which are not members of the European Union, in the United Kingdom following ""Brexit"", and in some countries where overall political instability seems incessant. Such political complexity of the given situation in Europe might diminish the capabilities of intelligence and security services that are normally highly successful. The core of the proposed book addresses the statistical analysis and modeling of the potential future of migrant inflow according to Turkey's possible motives in the future. Since the latter can be quite unpredictable, a relatively difficult forecasting problem is currently unavoidable, and possible uncertainties might be quite severe. The calculated prediction results imply that the migrant inflow trend will remain considerably high, particularly in the case if Turkey decides to completely open its borders for further migrations towards the Greek islands. This finding should be a serious warning to the EU to create a more efficient immigration policy in the near future. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the context of a fast and continuous expansion of tourism activities, particular attention is given to their impacts. The results of our path model suggest that different patterns of tourism dynamics coexist in European regions and that, for those where this sector assumes larger socio-economic importance, the contribution to the achievement of the “Millennium Goals”, as proposed by the United Nations, is relatively poor. Regions particularly endowed in natural resources reveal a weak socio-economic performance, while showing high levels of specialization in tourism, based on large scale and low value-added products and services, suggesting that new approaches to territorial design are required. This also leads to important spatial unbalances, with the most tourism-dependent European regions revealing relatively low levels of regional gross domestic product and high levels of unemployment. Despite their relatively good performance in terms of CO2-emissions, it seems important for those regions’ sustainable development to increase the value added in tourism, by reinforcing the linkages with other relevant regional economic sectors.

36621768300; 57195935408; 56865804400,The smart city and mobility: The functional polarization of urban flow,2017,"The paper deals with the definition of urban mobility, assuming that inside the city, the flow of mobility is deeply connected with the distribution, quality and use of the urban activities that 'polarize' different users (residents, commuters, tourists and city users). In this vision, ICT assume a strategic role, but the need to reconsider their role emerges in respect to the concept of a smart city. The consideration that 'urban smartness' does not depend exclusively on the ICT component or on the quantitative presence of technologies in the city, in fact, represents a shared opinion within the current scientific debate on the subject of the smart city. The paper assumes that, for the present urban contexts, the smart vision has to be related to an integrated approach, which considers the city as a complex system. Inside the urban system, the networks for both material and immaterial mobility interact with the urban activities that play a supporting role and have characteristics that affect the levels of urban smartness. Changes in urban systems greatly depend on the sorts of innovation technology that have intensely modified the social component to a far greater extent than others. Big Data, for instance, can help with knowledge of urban processes, provided they have to be well-interpreted and managed, and this will be of interest within the interactions among urban systems and the functioning of the system as a whole. Town planning has to take on responsibility in regard to approaching cities according to a different vision and updating its tools in order to steer the urban system steadfastly into a smartness state. In a systemic vision, this transition must be framed within the context of a process of governmental transformation that is carefully oriented towards the individuation of interactions among the different subsystems composing the city. According to this vision, the study of urban mobility can be related to the attractiveness generated by the different urban functions. The formalization of the degree of polarization, activated by urban functions, represents the main objective of this study. Among the urban functions, the study considers tourism as one of the most significant in the formalization of urban mobility flow inside the smart city. © 2017 IEEE.","Big data; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Polarization; Degree of polarization; Innovation technology; Integrated approach; Social components; Supporting role; Systemic approach; Tourism activities; Urban mobility; Smart city, functional polarization; smart city; systemic approach; tourism activity; urban mobility",English,Conference paper,367,3,Urban Sustainability
56150362700,From clusters to smart specialization: Tourism in institution-sensitive regional development policies,2017,"In the European Union and its neighborhood, regional development has increasingly come to focus on agglomerations during the last three decades. Notably, during the 1990s and early 2000s, clustering was the major policy focus in regional development. Currently, the concept of smart specialization is applied all over the European Union and is attracting interest in the EU’s neighborhood. The tourism sector particularly tends to agglomerate regionally and even locally. While there is a large body of literature describing tourism clusters and while tourism features as a priority sector in many regional development strategies such as smart specialization strategies, there is a research gap on policy approaches applying agglomeration-oriented policy concepts to tourism destinations in an institution-sensitive way. This article argues that both cluster policy and smart specialization can be of considerable value for institution-sensitive tourism development, either when adapted to the specificities of the tourism sector or when integrating tourism development into wider, cross-sectoral strategies of regional development. Such a policy can be a valuable tool for local and regional development, provided that policies are designed in an institution-sensitive manner and respond to the particular institutional context prevailing in a tourist destination.

The smart city paradigm can be successfully extended to wider areas related by socio-economical homogeneity bringing to the smart-land concept. In this paper it is proposed an integrated and intermodal methodology for the development of smart mobility systems that combine technological innovation in electric transportations and mobility services aimed at integrating the strategies of the public transportation with the benefits of the individual one.

In this paper, the AFC data are utilized to analysis and extract mobility patterns in a public transportation system. For this purpose, the smart ca rd data are inserted into a proposed metaheuristic-based aggregation model and then converted to O-D matrix between stops, since the size of O-D matrices makes it difficult to reproduce the measured passenger flows precisely. The proposed strategy is applied to a case study from Haaglanden, Netherlands. In this research, moth-flame optimizer (MFO) is utilized and evaluated for the first time as a new metaheuristic algorithm (MA) in estimating transit origin-destination matrices. The MFO is a novel, efficient swarm-based MA inspired from the celestial navigation of moth insects in nature. To investigate the capabilities of the proposed MFO-based approach, it is compared to methods that utilize the K-means algorithm, gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) and genetic algorithm (GA). The sum of the intra-cluster distances and computational time of operations are considered as the evaluation criteria to assess the efficacy of the optimizers. The optimality of solutions of different algorithms is measured in detail. The traveler's behavior is analyzed to achieve to a smooth and optimized transport system. The results reveal that the proposed MFO-based aggregation strategy can outperform other evaluated approaches in terms of convergence tendency and optimality of the results. The results show that it can be utilized as an efficient approach to estimating the transit O-D matrices.","Automated fare collection; Clustering; Genetic algorithm; Grey Wolf optimization; Moth flame optimizer; Origin-destination matrices, Genetic algorithms; Mass transportation; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Remote sensing; Transportation; Transportation routes; Zoning; Aggregation strategy; Automated fare collection; Clustering; Meta heuristic algorithm; Optimization algorithms; Optimizers; Origin destination matrices; Public transportation systems; Clustering algorithms",English,Conference paper,247,4,Mobility and Transportation

The aim of this paper is to present a multi-objective model based on a Fuzzy Inference System to be embedded in a mobile application that could assist cyclists in the selection of the smartest route to follow to reach their destination, in terms of travel costs (distance or time), level of air pollution and road safety. The features of the bike-sharing system (both traditional and free-floating) are considered in the generation of the final path, and also the starting and final stations to prefer (or the closest bike to pick up for the free-floating option) are provided. The proposed optimization model is dynamic, as it is synchronized with geolocated real time data regarding level of congestion and flows on the network, and availability of bikes/racks in the bike-sharing system. The mobile app gives bike users the possibility to plan, personalize and execute their trip with turn-by-turn guidance, allowing them to select the default optimal path, or to choose the desired travel time among the available route options, each of them accompanied by the related air pollution and safety.

16022832400,Softly smart: Experiencing place identity,2017,"A recent approach to place development is to construct integrated systems for managing cultural and identity resources so that they can be enjoyed through ‘experiential itineraries’. These itineraries are designed on the basis of a survey of existing heritage, with a view to support creative industries or to help develop new ones. Visitor experience of a place can be further enhanced and virtualised using smart technologies. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the studies on experiential itineraries. The studies are rooted in the disciplines of psychology and economy, and, more recently, in disciplines that study places. The author proposes an analysis and design software tool for identification and enhancement of cultural and identity resources. The tool is a dynamic and interactive platform for complex and sensitive management of qualitative data of a place. It is conceived as a single platform with different entry points, both private and public, for local authorities, professionals and citizens. The paper concludes with a brief presentation of case studies carried out in the historical centres of Palestrina and Gaeta in Italy, both characterised by low-impact tourism. The main objective of these studies was to achieve smart experiential knowledge of a place allowing sustainable enjoyment of its resources. © 2017 ICE Publishing.

Specifically, the study focuses on Apulia, a region of Italy that is attempting to achieve intelligent, sustainable, and inclusive growth through the use of a smart specialization strategy. Smart specialization is a strategy for supporting the socio-economic development of the European Union, based on identifying regional vocational areas and industries, and promoting place-based entrepreneurial development there. The relevance of tourism for smart specialization is confirmed by the dynamics that are currently reconfiguring the sector into a regionally-integrated and knowledge-intensive industry.

With regard to Europe, road transportation produces about 20% of the total CO2 emissions, out of which 40% is generated by urban mobility. It is estimated that vehicles cruising for free parking spaces cause 30% of the daily traffic congestion in an urban downtown area. In this article we attempt to show, through a simulation and an assessment model, how ITS may impact on urban parking management considering both people and freight transportation, and quantified the economic and social benefits which can be obtained. Although some benefits have been already examined by previous authors (e.g. in terms of reduction of time spent in searching a free parking spot), there is still a general lack of quantitative models able to assess the impacts of ITS technologies for urban parking. In this regard, one distinctive contribution of this article is that it combines people and freight transportation modes in a single model. First, we developed a model in order to simulate the urban parking system before and after the adoption of the Smart Parking solution. The output of the simulation model consists in the percentage reduction of the time spent by drivers of cars and vans in searching a free parking spot. Then, this percentage has been used to assess the economic and social benefits of a Smart Parking application in the City of Milan (Italy), in which the 'pay and display' parking spots are provided with sensors able to communicate if the space is free or not. The analysis considers two perspectives: on the one hand the parking operator company, which can increase its revenue due to the reduction of people that do not pay for parking. On the other hand, the city-users (i.e. citizens, tourists, off-site students, etc.), who can reduce the time spent for searching a free parking spot, thus reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The results obtained showed that these technologies would help each driver to save an average of 77.2 hours every year, 86.5 euros in fuel costs, and the entire city of Milan could reduce CO2 emissions by 44,470 tons per year (out of a total of 4,144,000 tons annually produced by road traffic in the area of Milan). In addition, these technologies help the parking operator company in improving the total revenue of around 9 million euros per year. If considering the required costs to implement the Smart Parking solution, the Discounted Payback Period for the parking operator is lower than 2 years. © 2017 IEEE.","Benefits; Intelligent transportation system; Model; Simulation; Smart city; Smart parking; Urban smart mobility, Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Freight transportation; Highway administration; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Investments; Models; Parking; Roads and streets; Smart city; Traffic congestion; Trucks; Benefits; Costs and benefits; Economic and social benefits; Intelligent transportation systems; Quantitative models; Road transportation; Simulation; Smart parking; Urban transportation",English,Conference paper,431,4,Mobility and Transportation

The aim of this research is to propose a Decision Support System (DSS) addressed mainly to shipping companies, allowing the choice, even en-route, of the hub port of destination for the successive multi-modal operations. The companies make choices in relation both to the ship location and to a dynamic accessibility indicator. The accessibility indicator is generally accepted as the parameter that better represents the interactions between a port and its hinterland. Different factors can influence the accessibility in maritime transport; some of them are characterized by low variability, while others show a high within-day dynamics. For example, the technical characteristics of ports (number of berths and their depths, number of cranes, storage area, etc.) belong to the first group; instead, the number of free berths, the delay time in freight loading and unloading operations, and weather conditions can change during the day. Their variability can be evaluated by a real-time monitoring, while the ship location can be easily obtained by GPS and radar signals. In the proposed DSS, we have considered data about the technical characteristics of ports and, depending on the request coming from ships, acquires the dynamic characteristics of each port, the ship location and the destination area. After the completion of the process, the DSS provides as output the port 'closer' to the requests expressed by the users. Since some current values of both the dynamic characteristics of ports and information provided by shipping companies are subject to uncertainty, we proposed a DSS based on a multivariate accessibility indicator. © 2017 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Freight transportation; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Location; Ships; Transportation; Unloading; Waterway transportation; Decision support system (dss); Dynamic characteristics; Loading and unloading operations; Logic decisions; Maritime transport; Maritime transportation; Real time monitoring; Shipping companies; Decision support systems, accessibility indicator; decision support system; maritime transportation",English,Conference paper,275,4,Mobility and Transportation

The availability of smart card data gives opportunities to better quantify disruption impacts on passengers' experienced journey travel time and comfort. For this, accurate journey inference from raw transaction data is required. Several rule-based algorithms exist to infer whether a passenger alighting and subsequent boarding is categorized as transfer or final destination where an activity is performed. Although this logic can infer transfers during undisrupted public transport operations, these algorithms have limitations during disruptions: disruptions and subsequent operational rescheduling measures can force passengers to travel via routes which would be non-optimal or illogical during undisrupted operations. Therefore, applying existing algorithms can lead to biased journey inference and biased disruption impact quantification. We develop and apply a new transfer inference algorithm which infers journeys from raw smart card transactions in an accurate way during both disrupted and undisrupted operations. In this algorithm we incorporate the effects of denied boarding, transferring to a vehicle of the same line (due to operator rescheduling measures as short-turning), and the use of public transport services of another operator on another network level as intermediate journey stage during disruptions. This results in an algorithm with an improved transfer inference performance compared to existing algorithms. © 2017 The Authors.

The model is usually estimated using travel survey data; however, little is known about how to use smart card data (SCD) for this purpose in a public transport network. Our study extracted trip information from SCD to model location choice of after-work activities. We newly defined the metrics of travel impedance in this case. Moreover, since socio-demographic information is missing in such anonymous data, we used observable proxy indicators, including commuting distance and the characteristics of one's home and workplace stations, to capture some interpersonal heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity is expected to distinguish the population and better explain the difference of their location choice behaviour. The approach was applied to metro travellers in the city of Shanghai, China. As a result, the model performs well in explaining the choices. Our new metrics of travel impedance to access an after-work activity result in a better model fit than the existing metrics and add additional interpretability to the results. Moreover, the proxy variables distinguishing the population seem to influence the choice behaviour and thus improve the model performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Shanghai; commuting; demand analysis; discrete choice analysis; heterogeneity; public transport; transportation planning, demand forecast; discrete choice model; location choice modelling; Public transport; smart card data; transport planning",English,Article,201,4,Mobility and Transportation

6505919720,Smart Infrastructure Development Makes Smart Cities—Promoting Smart Transport and ICT in Dakar,2017,"A smart city is viewed as a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous city that promotes a people-centric approach based on three core components and seven dimensions. The three core components are Smart City Foundation, Smart ICT and Smart Institutions and Laws, which in turn are the pillars of the seven dimensions of a smart city: Infrastructure Development, Environmental Sustainability, Social Development, Social Inclusion, Disasters Exposure, Resilience, and Peace and Security. The three components together with the seven dimensions make a Smart Economy. Infrastructure development has several elements across various social, economic and environmental dimensions. Here, our analysis focuses on those connecting people to several categories of services, particularly transport and ICT infrastructures. The first section analyses the classical option of connecting people to services through non-motorized means or motorized means of transport. The interaction between the development of urban spatial patterns and transport is thus a key factor shaping accessibility in cities both in physical and in socioeconomic terms. To access to services such as work, to the health centers, to the school or to the market among several other destinations, the share of motorized means is 40 % (public an private) compared to 60 % for the non-motorized means, mainly by walking. The public transport sector is predominantly informal (95 % against 5 % for the formal sector). Turning informal transport sector challenges to opportunities in the smart city making is a call along with the enhancement of the public sector with the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and other higher efficient means of public transport. In the absence of affordable, reliable public transport, the poor are no choice rather walking to access to services. It is urgent to make streets friendly to pedestrians with sufficient public spaces for social interactions. Today, it is recognized that the information and communication technology (ICT) development is an important enabler of accessing to services and must be integrated in the planning and management of transport systems. For these past 15 years, the Senegalese government has taken various steps to create an environment favorable to the development and use of ICT at all levels. It has created legal institutional framework to support regulatory mechanisms on the development and use of ICT and has also introduced ICT platforms such as E-Governance, E-Education, E-infrastructure and supports education and training on ICT.

Land uses benefit from areas with rich movement potential. Public transport stations similarly benefit from pedestrian spatial accessibility. What is less clear is how central area spatial characteristics help shape the fortunes of different modes that compete for public transport mode share for travel into central business districts (CBDs). The aim of this paper is to analyse the spatial characteristics of the main public transport stations in Brisbane’s CBD and South Bank by using space syntax, a computational approach derived from the work of Bill Hillier (1970), and to compare these spatial characteristics with public transport patronage. The configurational features of the areas surrounding key ferry stops, busway and railway stations are analysed. This is compared with patronage data obtained from Translink GoCard smart card ticketing data for the period October 2016. The results show that, as expected, ferry terminals are tightly bounded by the Brisbane River and have reduced spatial accessibility compared to most busway and train stations. Roma Street rail station – a key hub of the busway and rail network – has lesser spatial accessibility than the underground Central station, as well as less patronage. The outputs provide useful inputs for future observational studies of how public transport travellers make sense of unfamiliar environments and find their way from stops and stations to their end destinations. © 2017 ATRF, Commonwealth of Australia.

The decision-making process for transport planning needs to be informed, accountable, and founded on comprehensive, current, and reliable data. One of the major issues affecting the accuracy of the estimated origin-destination (O-D) matrices is sample size. Cost, time, precision, and biases are some issues associated with sample size. Smart card data can potentially provide much information based on better understanding and assessment of the sample size impact on the estimated O-D matrices. This paper uses South East Queensland (SEQ) data to study the effect of different data sample sizes on the accuracy level of the generated public transport O-D matrices and to quantify the sample size required for a certain level of accuracy. As a result, the total number of O-D trips for the whole network can be accurately estimated at all levels of sample sizes. However, a wide distribution of O-D trips appeared at different sample sizes. The large difference from the actual distribution at 100% sample size was readily captured at small sample sizes where more O-D pairs were not representative. The wide distribution of O-D trips at different levels of sample sizes caused significant errors even at large sample sizes.

50862025800; 57200146141,User assignment in a smart vehicles' network: Dynamic modelling as an agent-based model,2017,"Demand-responsive transportation systems diversify local transport supply with providing flexibility of routing and scheduling as well as affordable price. The classical Dial-a-ride problem enables to assign users to vehicles by minimization of a cost function under constraints. However, the projected itinerary of the vehicles is calculated on a global approach considering automatically each new users independently and a dispatcher tests a match between the user and all available service vehicles. Thus, matching calculation time is restricting for the large operational services. The objective of this paper is a reformulation of the problem with more flexibility and an aggregated solution to optimize calculation time. This modelling is based on a mobility system of transit vehicles with their own dispatcher and station infrastructures. The vehicles are shared dynamically and make extra-stops to collect travelers with various destinations. In addition, the users of the service have not any transfer and are transported directly to their destination stations. We constructed an agent-based model which maximizes the utility of each vehicle while satisfying its own constraints. The minimum travel and waiting times of the users and maximum occupancy of vehicles are the default ones. We propose then a new formulation of the problem on the maximization of the vehicle utility. Passengers' assignment to vehicles is controlled directly by the vehicle drivers on an aggregated level by origin destination pair. A case study illustrates the theoretical model and compares the efficiency of several service choices. A fleet of small vehicles seems to minimize the user waiting time. © 2017 The Authors.

25028815900; 57195538787,"Public transit fare structure and social vulnerability in Montreal, Canada",2017,"Research on social equity pertaining to transportation typically addresses how residents in a region have access to desirable destinations. Nonetheless, little is known about how public transit fare structures relate to social equity concerns. Some transit agencies charge more for fewer rides—weekly fares often cost more per ride than unlimited monthly fares, though monthly fares cost more upfront. For some social groups, in particular low-income earners, purchasing monthly passes may place a burden on their budget, and influence them to buy weekly passes instead. In this study, we analyze transit fare purchases of total monthly, weekly, and three or more weekly passes during the month of September 2014 in Montreal, Canada. We discovered that fare vendors in neighborhoods with low median household income and/or with a high proportion of unemployed residents are predicted to sell more weekly fares than vendors in neighborhoods with high household income and low rates of unemployment. Monthly fare purchases were not dependent on income or unemployed residents. Moreover, using smartcard data to track individual fare cards, we found that recurring purchases of three or more weekly passes depend on income and unemployment, so neighborhoods with socially vulnerable individuals are predicted to have more riders purchasing multiple weekly fares than socially secure neighborhoods. Our findings indicate that individuals residing in marginalized neighborhoods are likely to spend more money on transit fares over the course of a month compared to those residing in wealthy neighborhoods. These findings raise concerns regarding the financial burden that the existing fare structure in the city of Montreal imposes, especially on low-income groups. The methodology and findings from this study provide insight for transport planners, particularly those concerned with providing an equitable public transit system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Canada; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]; Budget control; Economic and social effects; Employment; Purchasing; Smart cards; Urban transportation; Equity; Low incomes; Monthly fares; Transit fares; Weekly fares; equity; low income population; public transport; transportation economics; travel behavior; Sales, Equity; Low-income; Monthly fares; Transit fares; Weekly fares",English,Article,287,4,Mobility and Transportation

The case of the city of Porto",2017,"The so-called Smart Cities have been playing an important role in the academic literature as well as in the agenda of public policies. With the forward thinking of “creating” new urban development models, the cities intend to strategically positioning themselves and at the same time develop cooperation networks. Frequently using the Information and Communication Technologies (while as a means to an end and not as an end itself), the cities try to assure a greater economic competitiveness, the environmental sustainability and the reinforcement of citizenship (calling out to people to participate, in the scope of an inclusive logic and in an appeal to creativity and social responsibility).Even the 2020 European strategy promotes this development.The geographic scope of the study is limited to the city of Porto. This is justified by the fact that, in 2015, Porto was one the five European cities selected to participate in the GrowSmarter (model of organization of cities of the future), an ambitious project with the objective of making Europe more sustainable and environmentally intelligent. Besides that, the Portuguese Smart Cities Index, 2016, points out the city of Oporto as the Portuguese city with better results in what concerns the main vectors of intelligence (policy, strategies and projects implemented, edification, mobility, energy and smart services).At the same time, in the international press, the city of Porto appears as a reference for its architectural wealth and as one of the more indicated European destinations for one who would like to enjoy quality holidays at a reasonable price.That is perhaps why Shermans Travel presents Porto as one of the top 10 destinations for intelligent tourists. The purpose of the present study is to understand if the emergence of smart cities can be in some way connected to the appearance of smart tourism. For such a purpose, we will study the city of Porto and a survey will be conducted among the tourists of the city.This article compiles some of the first results of the study, referring to the data collected during the months of August and September of 2017, and intends mainly to set out some hypotheses about the motivation for the choice of a tourist destination, that will be developed in future works. © 2017, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela.

In fact, the existing railway line lies along the Piave valley and connects cities on the Veneto plain with Belluno and the Cadore area, whereas public road transport links the train stations with the other towns in Belluno province. Given this background, a new railway line (from Calalzo to Cortina d’Ampezzo passing through Auronzo) could meet the province mobility needs, leading to a potential increase in traffic and thus improving economic and tourism development in the area. Indeed, historical as well as natural and tourist (ski) areas would benefit. Moreover, a new railway line is an attractive and valid alternative to the development of the existing road network, allowing a proper integration between rail and road transportation systems. In this sense, a preliminary design has shown noise levels at least halved with respect to a road context eliminating any level crossing, thus also proving to be a convincing solution under the environmental point of view. However, a more specific and detailed assessment of the environmental impact of the new railway line will be necessary taking into account that the region involved is one of the most scenic Dolomite areas (UNESCO Heritage Site), with complex morphology and geology. A 45 km long single-track railway layout has been designed hypothesizing two passenger trains per hour and assuming a minimum speed of 80 km/h, a minimum bend radius of 300 m, a maximum longitudinal slope of 20‰ and gauge of 1435 mm.

Port cities are cities which grow up in close connection with their ports. Over the years, ports influenced cities development becoming the main driver for urban sprawl. Nowadays many port areas are no more exploited for port’s trade. Several cities used these spaces designing modern waterfronts for leisure, culture and tourism activities. Waterfront revitalisation is also fundamental for urban mobility. Port cities can use these areas to develop new transport infrastructure promoting sustainable mobility. In a densely built up area it is increasingly difficult to find space for bicycle lanes or pedestrian zones, waterfront revitalization projects can be the perfect occasion to solve this problem.

The project focuses on the Mediterranean Ro-Ro Freight sector. The main objective of the study is to design a new optimised corridor between the two shores of the Mediterranean sea. The new corridor, founded on the hub-based concept, is composed by two hub ports: Porto Torres (Italy) and Beirut (Lebanon) serving the north-western area and the south-eastern area, respectively. The new network must be able to ensure scheduled services enabling shipping companies, and consequently all the operators using their services, in order to obtain more reliable delivery times, as opposed to the current system whereby delivery times cannot be guaranteed. The application-area includes 24 ports located within 8 Mediterranean countries. A data collection process has been performed in order to collect the information necessary to define the existing scenario and to characterise nodes (ports) and arcs (links) of the new network. The collected data are divided into demand and supply variables. In order to characterize the new designed transport network in terms of optimal services frequencies, capacities and schedules a two-step optimization approach has been defined: the first step defines the optimal frequencies and capacities of connection services along the various routes; the second step defines an optimal timetable for the organization of the services identified by the previous step. Origin/Destination matrices have been used to calibrate the network and alternative scenarios of future demand have been built-up, in order to determine how the new network structure can be able to match changing demand over the years.

Four spatial regression models are used to investigate the effect on the MAG of six factors of the built environment (distance to city public centers, residential density, landuse mix, bus stop density, metro station density and road network density). The results show that travel time for a given origin to destination (OD) trip is likely to be larger by public transport than by car, especially for a trip of longer travel time. The MAG values of all the communities are larger than 0, indicating that when compared with public transport, travelling by car takes less travel time for individuals. Residential density, land-use mix, bus stop density and metro rail station density have significant negative direct impacts and indirect impacts (spatial spillover effects) on MAG, which indicates that appropriate increase in community residential density, providing diversified service facilities within a community, and improving public transport supply are beneficial to promote modal shift. Specifically, the role of metro rail is greater than that of buses. However, the road network density has significant direct positive impacts on MAG, and its spillover effect is also significantly positive, which indicates that building more roads is not an effective way to narrow the accessibility gap between public transport and cars but may facilitate more car travel instead. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment; Modal accessibility gap; Spatial regression model; Spatial spillover effects; Travel O-D point Intelligent Query System, China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; accessibility; numerical model; public transport; regression analysis; spatial analysis; spillover effect; travel time",English,Article,254,4,Mobility and Transportation

By aggregating across OD pairs, this categorization scheme summarizes the multi-modal aspects of public transport network usage. The methodology can also be applied to subsets of data filtered by time of day or geography. The categorization results can inform performance analysis of OD pairs, allowing planners to make comparisons between pairs served by different combinations of modes.

7006695697,Future bus transport contracts under a mobility as a service (MaaS) regime in the digital age: Are they likely to change?,2017,"The digital age has opened up new opportunities to improve the customer experience in using public transport. Specifically, we see the role of smart technology in the hands of customers as the new rubric to deliver services that are individualised to the needs and preferences of current and future public transport users. This frontline of service delivery has become known as mobility as a service (MaaS) whereby an individual can book a service delivered through a range of possible modes of transport. At one extreme we have point-to-point car based services such as Uber, Lyft, BlaBlaCar and RydHero (for children), with futuristic suggestions of these gravitating to driverless vehicles (cars and buses). Variations around this future are bus-based options that include smart bookable ‘point-via-point-to-point’ services that offer up options on travel times and fares (with the extreme converting to the point-to-point car service, possibly also operated by a bus business); as well as the continuation of conventional bus services (with larger buses) where the market for smart MaaS is difficult or inappropriate to provide (e.g., contracted (often free) school bus services). This paper, as a think piece, presents a number of positions that could potentially represent future contexts in which bus services might be offered, recognising that a hybrid multi-modal state of affairs may be the most appealing new contract setting, enabling the design of contracts to be driven by the mode-neutral customer experience, and the growing opportunity to focus on MaaS. We suggest that the adrenal rush for mobility services, however, may not deliver the full solution that supporters are suggesting. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive industry; Sales; Tourism industry; Travel time; User experience; Bus transport; Customer experience; Digital technologies; Mobility service; Point to point; Public transport; Service delivery; Smart technology; bus transport; mobility; public transport; service sector; technological change; Bus transportation, Digital technology intervention; Disruption technologies; Mobility as a service (MaaS); Public transport contracts",English,Article,266,4,Mobility and Transportation

We evaluate 5066 voyages performed by 483 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) between 44 countries for the period 2013–2015 and estimate the potential for fuel savings if unproductive waiting time at the destination ports can instead be utilized to reduce the average sailing speed. We find that even if only 50% of the estimated waiting time can be avoided, the consequential slow-down in average sailing speeds leads to an average reduction of 422 tonnes of CO2 and 6.7 tonnes of SOx emissions per voyage. Our findings are important for policy making and the optimization of voyage management in shipping companies as they illustrate the substantial savings on fuel costs and emissions from the broad implementation of Virtual Arrival compared to the prevailing first-come first-served berthing policy and the standard charterparty term of sailing with ‘utmost dispatch’. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AIS; Energy efficiency; Fuel consumption saving; SEEMP; Virtual arrival, Artificial intelligence; Carbon dioxide; Fuel economy; Fuels; Ships; Automated identification systems; Efficiency managements; First come first served; International maritime organizations; International scrutiny; SEEMP; Very large crude carriers; Virtual arrival; emission control; energy efficiency; fuel consumption; policy making; shipping; Energy efficiency",English,Article,249,11,Rural Resource Management

Moreover, the bike is used as an alternative transportation for tourists who want to explore the visited city. By seeing the potential of a large application in the bike rentals, some cities have been installed a 'Bike Sharing System', which is a bike rental system that involves digital signage as authentication and security process when the user making transactions in borrowing a bike. But the price of these devices is very expensive in installation. This paper discusses the design and implementation of bike sharing systems (BSS) that use simple digital signage technology. It is consist of Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) as main displays and Near Field Communication (NFC) interaction modules which are separately developed. The NFC module serves as a reader, and the LCD is used as a user interface for some functions, including i) registration process, ii) renting the bikes, iii) returning the bikes, iv) top-up balances and several another information. Based on the results of the functionality test, the developed system can work well. It is expected that the system can be applied massively in order to be enjoyed by communities in other Indonesian cities because our proposed prototype offers more affordable price.

58267728400; 57209988987,Destination and activity estimation,2017,"Household travel surveys contain, besides travel information, sociodemographic information which plays an important role in analyzing travel dynamics. Disadvantages of such surveys are though that these are costly to conduct, time-consuming and often do not cover more than 2-3% of the population leading to possible biases and errors in reporting. On the other hand, smart card data provide real-time, accurate and detailed on board transactions records of each user, however, only cover a subset of all trips. Further, smart card data do not usually contain socio-demographic information and hence, one of the most important parameter “trip purpose or activity” is missing. This problem is of growing interest and several algorithms to infer the trip purpose are proposed. In this chapter, the discussion is on trip destination and purpose estimation methods and a 1-day Household Person Travel Diary Survey (HHPTD) is utilized to generate a framework for assigning trip purposes to trips. Activities studied are “home”, “work”, “school”, “academy” and “shopping”. Decision trees and rule-based models, namely, R-Tree and C50, are used to estimate the trip purpose. HHPTD is utilized to train the datasets and applied on the smart card dataset to calculate the probabilities of different activities. Activity duration, location and start time are the parameters which were analysed for developing the inference framework. The spatial context of this study is Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) with a focus on Seoul City.

Peak and off-peak periods have been defined according to the validation frequency and a users' segmentation according to age intervals has been implemented. Then, the origin-destination matrix has been estimated using the time interval between two validations to outline the different legs of the journey. Finally, the transport demand has been matched with the existing services showing which areas were not properly covered by public transport.

On the basis of the previous studies, the research builds an index system on the tourism competitiveness evaluation of smart tourism city, including 5 indexes of first grade, 14 of second grade and 33 of third grade, selects the first 12 pilot cities of national smart tourism such as Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu, Dalian and Xiamen, constructs the BP neural network model of tourism competitiveness evaluation of smart tourism city through the simulation computation, and applies the model to evaluate and analyze the tourism competitiveness of the smart tourism cities mentioned above. The results indicated that the scientific and technological innovation of the smart tourism city is the most important first grade index which impacts the tourism competitiveness. The other first grade indexes are economic development of smart tourism city, support capability of tourism development, tourism development potentiality and environmental support capability ranked according to their importance; the overall level of tourism competitiveness of Chinese smart tourism cities is not high and extremely uneven and the smart tourism cities are divided into five categories according to their own evaluation level and competition situation. The first category includes Beijing, which is the benchmark of tourism competitiveness of Chinese smart tourism cities. All the five first grade indexes of Beijing run ahead of other smart tourism cities. Its comprehensively-evaluated value reaches 0.887, rated AA level, and its competition situation is superior. The second category includes Nanjing, whose evaluation value of the environmental support capability of smart tourism city is tied for the first place with Beijing. Its evaluation values of economic development power, scientific and technological innovation, and support capability of development are all ranked 2nd. The comprehensively-evaluated value of Nanjing is 0.536, rated BB level, which is significantly higher than that of other smart tourism cities except Beijing and its competition situation is better. The third category cities, including Wuhan, Dalian, Chengdu, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Zhenjiang and Yantai, are representatives of the present general level of tourism competitiveness of Chinese smart tourism cities, whose 5 first grade index values are all low and there are no remarkable gaps between them. Their comprehensively-evaluated values are between 0.3 and 0.4, rated B level and their competition situation is on the average. The fourth category includes Fuzhou and Luoyang, the vast majority of its first index values are lower. Their comprehensively- evaluated values are between 0.2 and 0.3, rated CC level and their competition situation is weak. The fifth category includes Huangshan, whose comprehensively- evaluated value is just 0.176, rated C level and its competition situation is weaker. The BP neural network model of tourism competitiveness evaluation of smart tourism city is of better scientificity, universality and operability. Judging the tourism competitiveness of smart tourism cities according to their evaluation values, comparing it with the index system to find and bridge the gaps, and monitoring the evaluation index dynamically will be an important direction of tourism competitiveness research of smart tourism cities. © 2017, Science Press.

Two different travel documents are available, travel passes and pay-per-use, with different validation rules: check-in only for travel passes and check-in and check-out for pay-per-use.Data produced by this electronic ticketing system employing smart cards allow to perform a detailed analysis of each user's behaviour, and calculate time and space distributions of each passenger trip. In detail, data originating from smart card transactions allow to trace back the trip chains, establish journey origins and destinations, and produce a ""travel diary"" for each passenger. Based on this data, performance indicators (i.e. load factor) as well as user mobility patterns and origin-destination matrices can be calculated in an automated and reliable way.This article presents a methodology for assessing the quality of the data collected when information about boarding and alighting stops is available from the (on board) validation system. It also presents an algorithm to assign a destination for each trip where only the boarding information is available.In the case study of the Province of Cuneo, it was found that 91% of the pay-per-use journey data are reliable and can be used for further analysis, whereas with the use of the proposed algorithm it was possible to estimate the destinations for 82% of the travel pass trips. © 2016 The Authors.",", electronic ticketing; OD matrices; public transport; transport planning",English,Conference paper,251,4,Mobility and Transportation
55599058500; 43361072700,"Impact of urban policy on public transportation in gauteng, South Africa: Smart or dumb city systems is the question",2017,"Policy on public transport often directs where infrastructure and investment is directed. Currently, the discourse is towards transport infrastructure investments that facilitate the attainment of the so-called smart city and smart mobility status. This status is often seen as the panacea towards all the public transport problems that among others include traffic congestion and unreliability. This chapter grapples with the question; to what extent have the urban planning policies in South Africa and Gauteng province been instrumental in the pursuit of efficient, effective and responsive public transport systems? Have the transport systems led to either smart or dumb city systems. The Gauteng province has put in place policies such as the Gauteng 25 year integrated master plan (ITMP 25) that has a vision to better the lives of Gauteng residents through the establishment of a smart and efficient public transport system. The ITMP 25 also seeks to attract foreign investments and boost tourism through land use densification that supports the use and efficiency of public transport systems. The policy also aims to reinforce the passenger rail-network as the backbone of the public transport system in Gauteng, and to extend the integrated rapid and road-based public transport networks that assist to strengthen freight hubs; thus ensuring effective travel demand management and mainstreaming non-motorized transport. As a result, Gauteng has invested in bus rapid infrastructure (Reya-Vaya within the City of Johannesburg, the Gautrain which is a high-speed rail network that caters for all three metro municipalities) and investments in non-motorized transport lanes in Johannesburg. The study applies smart city and smart mobility indicators to determine the level of smartness of the Reya Vaya, Gautarin and cycling infrastructure. The results indicate a steady uptake in public transport and use of cycling as a means of transport as well as a paradigm shift towards smart mobility by Johannesburg and Gauteng residents. Nevertheless, this has yielded unintended consequences such as the reinforcement of spatial segregation and inadequate use of new transport infrastructure. Parts of the challenges are a direct result of weak policy formulation and implementation strategies at both national and provincial levels as well as a deep culture that prefers private automobiles to public transport. There is therefore need to improve transportation policy and promote evidence based transportation policy. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",", Economics; Investments; Land use; Motor transportation; Railroad transportation; Smart city; Traffic congestion; Transportation routes; Urban planning; Urban transportation; High speed rail network; Implementation strategies; Public transport networks; Public transport systems; Transport infrastructure; Transportation policies; Travel demand management; Unintended consequences; Nonmotorized transportation",English,Book chapter,381,4,Mobility and Transportation

As this growth continues, problems in the current structure are found. Particularly in the U.S., the first mile and the last mile of an individual's commute can be the weakest links due to the distance from their home to a public transportation acces point and from another access point to their final destination. This is especially true for those with impaired mobility, e.g. injury or disability. In this paper, a system called SMOOTH (Smart Mobile Operation: OSU Transportation Hub) will be discussed. The primary goal of SMOOTH is to augment current public transportation infrastructure by providing users with access to a heterogeneous network of on-demand autonomous vehicles. A mobile-first web application is used to schedule the pickup and drop-off locations of the trip. The system has been designed to maximize scalability for future city-wide deployments.

Citizens can pick up and drop off bikes among stations around the city. The system may be used for both work-related and leisure purposes including supporting last-mile transportation and tourism. In order to sustain and attract more users into the bike system, understanding demand and trip patterns is a key objective. Further, due to the asymmetric and dynamic nature of user demands, some stations tend to run out of bikes whereas other stations tend to be full (impeding returns). Rebalancing stations to provide high quality services to fit pick up and drop off demand is a major challenge in bike share systems. In this paper, we present a three-layer SMARTBIKE system to assist city administrators in Fortaleza, Brazil with bike share system decision making. This is an international cooperative effort between academia and government to aid in building a Smart City. The first layer of the proposed tool includes ¿-means clustering technology to understand the true demand of the city bike share system. We designed a novel station network analysis in the second layer to provide insights on system usage patterns and to help with the rebalancing strategy. The third layer provides rebalancing support at the facility and operation level.

The proposed platform integrates mobility data from various sources such as Open Data, mobile applications, sensors and government data, allowing for its visualisation and analysis while making it actionable through associated third party mobile applications. We propose to inject the city mobility policies to the third party mobile applications which provide services related to the city resources. In this way we form a value chain which connects different actors (city governments, mobile application providers, POI owners, companies that require logistics in cities, and final users) who both take a part in improving the mobility in urban areas, and benefit from the way mobility policies being executed.

57207795658,Smart growth through joint highway air rights and transit-oriented development,2017,"As part of a broader smart growth strategy transportation nodes, from their initial inception, have been organizing forces in a city's master-planning process. This role has become more important with time and with the addition of modes of transportation, such as buses and trams, which are being co-housed in these structures. At the same time, driving and the use of highways have been a fact of life for many people who live in circumstances that demand car travel. Major highways and mass transit links generally do a good job of connecting primary destinations. It is the connections from primary destinations to networks of local streets and bus routes that can be problematic. At the community level, local governments concerned with the smart growth and fiscal potential of their communities are beginning to establish development policies to promote connectivity. At the project level, urban designers and developers are increasingly asked to establish good connectivity to adjacent properties as well as within their developments. In these efforts, local governments provide further incentives for new development to locate near transit lines and stations, with design guidelines for projects aimed at improving access to transit and all the integrated or adjacent amenities. This paper attempts to discern the qualitative aspects with regards to the urban design strategies employed and also to present socioeconomic indicators that support financial viability of this kind of development model through the utilization of case studies in Boston, MA and Seattle, WA, citing projects that were completed in the mid to the late 1980s (completed before the recessions of 1989-1992 and 1999-2001) as well as examining and comparing the effect of these developments on socioeconomic indicators in the decades before, during and after project completion. © 2017 WIT Press.","Boston; Massachusetts; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]; Planning; Smart city; Transportation; Urban planning; Highway air rights; Right of way; Smart growth; Transit oriented development; Urban fabrics; bridge; connectivity; fiscal reform; guideline; incentive; local government; road; smart city; socioeconomic indicator; urban design; urban development; urban growth; urban planning; Urban growth, Highway air rights; Right-of-way bridging; Smart growth; Transit-oriented development; Urban fabric re-stitching",English,Article,289,3,Urban Sustainability

This paper proposes a new methodology to design a skip-stop strategy for urban rail lines aiming to minimize total travel time while at the same time serve the maximum number of passengers in off-peak hours. Different from the conventional 'A/B' scheme, the proposed new scheme called the Flexible Skip-Stop Scheme (FSSS) can provide more combinations of stop modes to accommodate passenger demand. The train headway is optimized, while the train capacity is taken into consideration. A Genetic Algorithm is developed to efficiently search for the optimal solution. Based on one-way real passenger origin-destination (O-D) pairs and entry and exit time data at the stations obtained from the smartcard system, a case study on a single metro rail line in the City of Shenzhen has been conducted. Kinds of scenarios are designed, the privilege of the station which able to be skipped is limited to specific stations according to their passenger flow. Results show that the high demand station trends to achieve the optimal under the All-stop scheme, while skip a low demand station would bring sizable savings for total passenger travel time. This can effectively limit the feasible solution set and reduce the computation time. In addition, tests show that the model can produce skip-stop schedules that not only decrease the total passenger travel time at a given service level, but it also generates significant transit agency cost savings, while the number of skipped stations of the optimized skip-stop operation scheme remains stable. © 2016 IEEE.","Genetic algorithms; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Smart cards; Traffic control; Transportation; Travel time; Feasible solution set; flexible skip-stop scheme; Optimal solutions; Origin-destination pairs; Passenger travels; skip-stop scheme; Transit operating speed; Urban rail transit; Light rail transit, flexible skip-stop scheme; skip-stop scheme; urban rail transit operation",English,Conference paper,258,4,Mobility and Transportation

This increased travel demand has placed a strain on the surrounding traffic of such external traffic hubs. Also, the original designs of connecting lines may not be appropriate for new travel needs. Therefore, a study of passenger intracity OD (origin and destination) patterns can reveal the influence on inner-city traffic and provide a basis for urban transport planning. This research examines the rail and bus passenger OD spatial-temporal patterns of a typical second-tier city (Suzhou) in China by utilizing the Getis-Ord Gi∗ statistic and other statistical analyses of taxi GPS data. The results indicated the following two different functions of transport in Suzhou: tourism transport and transit transfer to external transportation. Most passengers were distributed in places of interest and commercial districts within the central town, and some passengers were distributed in other external traffic hubs. In addition, Suzhou Park Railway Station and Suzhou New District Railway Station, which are located farther away from the central town, better served passengers located in the neighborhood and facilitated the dispersal of non-tourist passengers. Furthermore, while there are some connections between several Suzhou external traffic hubs, there are no metros or shuttle buses between some related stations, such as Suzhou South Bus Passenger Station and Suzhou Railway Station.

To compete in this virtual arena, picking, packing and shipping single items and small volume orders to customers, needs to be done as efficiently as possible. Orders require delivery to customers - not weekly or bi-weekly as with retail stores, but typically within 24 to 72 hours. In a conventional marketplace supply chain model, the sellers make the goods ready based on customer orders and signal to their logistics partner for a pickup. The supply chain activities typically start with the consolidation of load for a given geography and then distributed within the supply chain network. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to estimate the sortation wave timings in a marketplace distribution center to optimize transport TAT's subject to inbound load profile, sortation capacity at a distribution center, transport mode and lane-wise load split and transit time between destinations. The model which has been tested by simulations with different illustrative examples, works on the logic of earliest deadline first scheduling algorithm to maximize the desired objective function. Each destination has a transport cut-off before which its corresponding load needs to be sorted and bagged for dispatch.

Seeing this opportunity, many researchers have developed tools to obtain valuable information from the available data. However, the case of Transantiago is particularly advantageous because all buses have GPS devices and the smart card presents an overall 97% penetration rate. We describe a successful experience of collaboration between academia and the public transport authority to develop tools based on passive data processing. We include a brief description of the Transantiago system and the agreements made to develop the aforementioned tools. We also describe the methods developed to obtain valuable information like public transport trips origin-destination matrices, speed profiles of buses and service quality indicators, among others.

By identifying two important anchor points (night-time anchor point and day-time anchor point) from individual cellphone trajectories, this study proposes an anchor-point based trajectory segmentation method to partition cellphone trajectories into trip chain segments. By selecting trip chain segments that can potentially be served by bicycles, two indicators (inflow and outflow) are generated at the cellphone tower level to estimate the potential demand of incoming and outgoing bicycle trips at different places in the city and different times of a day. A maximum coverage location-allocation model is used to suggest locations of bike sharing stations based on the total demand generated at each cellphone tower. Two measures are introduced to further understand characteristics of the suggested bike station locations: (1) accessibility; and (2) dynamic relationships between incoming and outgoing trips. The accessibility measure quantifies how well the stations could serve bicycle users to reach other potential activity destinations. The dynamic relationships reflect the asymmetry of human travel patterns at different times of a day.

7101974379,Transit origin-destination estimation,2017,"Smart card transactions represent a passively collected source of information on passenger travel. With geographic coordinates and time stamps for these transactions, it is possible to infer the passenger’s origin and destination of a journey. In cases where only one transaction takes place at the origin stop during a journey or trip leg (a so-called “tapon”), an alighting location must be inferred. This chapter reviews the common methods and assumptions guiding inference of destinations. To supplement this review, it considers methods that convert the origins and destinations from smart card transactions into estimates of origindestination flows (O-D matrices). Such estimates may be complicated by the interpretation of the smart card data, particularly with respect to activities that might occur at transfer locations. Finally, this chapter explores other methods employed to look at patterns in O-D journeys and in passenger tours throughout a day. Several avenues for continuing research in these areas are highlighted. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",", Information systems; Transportation; Card transactions; Geographic coordinates; Guiding inference; Origin and destinations; Origin destination; Origin-destination flows; Passenger travels; Time stamps; Smart cards",English,Book chapter,161,4,Mobility and Transportation

Among other issues, sustainable religious tourism means accessibility to the sanctuaries, protection of cultural and heritage values of the local community, benefits for the local residents and meaningful experience for visitors. Authors were especially interested in the less popular, more remotely located holy sites in Mazovia Region (Poland) and two concerns: readiness to respond the needs of persons with different disabilities and local community opinion on tourists. As was documented by our research outcomes despite the recent numerous improvements, the most popular rural sanctuaries in Mazovia Region, remain only partially accessible for persons with disabilities. As masses of pilgrims have a significant effect on wellbeing and everyday life quality of residents (contributing both to positive and to negative effects), those who accept that tourists are important for economic development, benefit from it, creating 'smart host area'.

56358331700; 57192876841,Social conflicts in coastal touristic cities. Holistic renovation of buildings in Benidorm,2017,"Mediterranean Touristic populated areas in the 70s pose great disadvantages when it comes to renovating. The transformation of such tourist resorts into permanent residence implies problems derived from the lack of design flexibility, excess of regulation and environmental issues. These holiday apartments, due to their dimensions and current conditions, are quite economical within the current housing market. However, the problems mentioned above can be seen when one has a close look at the high energetic consumption, the small dimension of the inhabited places, the lack of security against fire and the low level of hygrothermal comfort. Benidorm underwent a large development in the 70s. As many other coastal Mediterranean cities, it has problems in providing its citizens and tourists with their needs. Many conflicts arise from sharing a common space, like the ones abovementioned. It is also worth mentioning that inhabited flats and houses have originated several social problems. This paper intends to show a holistic strategy of intervention in a specific building that can also be implemented in other blocks of flats. This intervention is meant to redistribute the building both internally and externally, so the useful floor area is increased. Security in case of fire is solved by adding a second staircase, with two evacuation routes. There will also be a renovation with a new structural framework that will give a better climatic regulation function, and thus better energy efficiency. Besides, action will be taken over the resort gardens to produce a sustainable building outlook. In this way, there will be an improvement in the quality of life of the permanent employees working for the big number of tourists in this city. © 2017 WIT Press.","Alicante [Comunidad Valencia]; Benidorm; Comunidad Valencia; Spain; Energy efficiency; Intelligent buildings; Sustainable development; Cultural heritages; Environmental issues; Landscape planning and designs; Mediterranean cities; Quality of life; Regulation functions; Structural frameworks; Urban safety; building construction; cultural heritage; energy efficiency; fire management; housing market; landscape planning; Mediterranean environment; quality of life; safety; social conflict; social security; sustainability; Environmental regulations, Cultural heritage; Landscape planning and design; Quality of life; Urban safety and security",English,Article,278,3,Urban Sustainability

Two new features characterize the proposed solution: partial ridesharing, according to which the riders can walk to reach the driver along his/her route when driving to the destination; the possibility to share the ride when the driver has already started the ride by modeling the mobility to reach the driver destination. To analyze which features of the population bring better performance to changing the characteristics of the users, we also conducted emulations. When compared with current solutions, CLACSOON allows for achieving a decrease in the waiting time of around 55% and an increase in the driver and passenger success rates of around 4% and 10%, respectively.

57192911002; 57192909020,Taxi of the future: Big data analysis as a framework for future urban fleets in smart cities,2017,"Smart city needs smart mobility—travel should be made as convenient as possible through sustainable urban transport solutions. Transportation systems in many parts of the world are facing unprecedented challenges in the 21st century as increasing population, urbanization, and motorization growth continue to pressure these systems. Hence, cities need smart planning for a sustainable future, and this calls for greater governance across all levels of transportation decision making. Reimagining the role of information technologies (IT) and connectivity in today’s cities enables us to realize the promise of smart mobility through the Internet of Things (IoT) which provides interlinking of vast networks, devices, and data which have thus far never been linked. As such, one of the strategies for smart cities to overcome the urban-mobility challenge is to spearhead the technological leap with big data. Within the frame of smart cities, leveraging big data and IoT is considered to be a key enabler for transforming urban mobility system towards higher flexibility and better integration with existing transport modes, as well as providing smart and sustainable mobility solutions such as sharing concepts, electric vehicles, and autonomous driving. However, the prerequisite for taking advantage of big-data analytics is to first address the issues of data availability and accessibility. Hence, by highlighting the need for urban data, this paper aims to draw attention to the taxi as an essential part of future urban fleets in smart cities for the shift towards sustainable mobility. Taxis solve a niche in the urban-mobility system as they provide to the general public flexible, door-to-door services. Such a semi-private character enables full-area coverage to better support travel demands, and thus the taxi industry has a significant function in the mobility system. However, compared to other transport modes, the taxi is often overlooked and receives little attention from planners and policy makers. So what does the taxi of the future look like? The project “Future Urban Taxi” rethinks the taxi from bottom up. It focuses on howthe taxi: (1) as a vehicle, has to adapt to user demands and specific urban contexts; and (2) as a system, can be integrated into the mobility web of a city in a more effective and sustainable way. This is one of the sub-projects under the initiative “Ambient Mobility Lab” which is supported with funding by the Ministry of Finance and Economics of the federal state Baden-Württemberg in Germany. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Decision making; Door to door service (freight); Internet of things; Metadata; Population statistics; Smart city; Taxicabs; Tourism industry; Autonomous driving; Data availability; Internet of thing (IOT); Mobility systems; Sustainable mobility; Taxi; Transportation decision making; Transportation system; Urban transportation, Big data; Internet of things; Smart cities; Smart mobility; Sustainable mobility; Taxi",English,Article,400,4,Mobility and Transportation

56988663000,Smart cities and a model of global communication: An approach to the geography of communication,2017,"This study seeks to answer if and to what extent urban communication may be either a guarantee or a possibility to create a citizen identity. The concept of 'global models to urban communication' applied herein must be understood as communication processes of constitution and construction of the city, that is, each city seeks local/global solutions for the amount of available data/information from the most varied networks. Some theoreticians and advisers assert the prevailing of the city for the future of all, within holistic views and possibilities, in which the city is both paramount to people's sustainable future and vital for the future of the whole natural surroundings; however, one verifies a new process of ghettrification, which we indicate and analyze. The city we address is code-named Smartcity; however, recent studies also indicate the necessity of greater humanization in the development of the processes emerging therein, as well as their demythicizing, either regarding cities as the most intelligent of the planet or as the greatest urban foolishness. The study also points out the emergence of some contradictions in the construction and in the process of consolidation of smartcities. Such contradictions relate to the destruction of the socio-environmental nature. The “inhumanity” in the Smartcities can be understood by considering the dialectic relationship between hegemonic and non-hegemonic agents who are spread and utilizing the territories. In this sense, Santos indicates that, for the hegemonic agents, the used territory is a resource, and for the nonhegemonic agents, it is their shelter. The former ones utilize the territory aiming their personal interests, with specific investments in each part of the territory, which amplifies even more the social and territorial divisions of labor; the latter ones, in order to assure their surviving, seek to adapt locally, by creating and recreating strategies within the places. As global models of communication, the Smartcities do not “color” an already set reality; on the contrary, as participants in the human construction of space, they regroup the possibilities that already exist via communication, opening paths to interaction, information, and also to control and monitoring. The new model of urban communication, which intends to be Global, if, by chance, inaugurates a new mode of participating, chiefly due to the volume of sales and profits it generates, by regarding the city a product within the globalized market, also points out new vulnerabilities and strangeness. These are vulnerabilities in an identity that is still being formed, which are based in rules and orders; the power of a brand that is fixed in the local imaginary and that would redeem all the difficulties that exist within a “normal city”. It is also a strangeness concerning to accept and cohabit with the other and his/her differences. The standardization of identity and of the mode of viewing and living in the city is not an exclusivity of the smartcities. The citizen's participation, for its turn, is not linear, though we cannot say that there is effective participation in the main demands that occur in the cities. In the case of the studied cities, the offer of the Branding City itself, along with its media spectacles of colors, brands, consumption, technologies, serve as an anesthesia to a more critical participation and thought, and lead part of the population to conformism. In these moments of displacement, geopolitically speaking, usually from south to north, for many different reasons, the urban communication could have, in the Smartcities, a destination in which the dialogues would be open and facilitated by technologies, which the public and private agents boast of implanting and offering, thereby favoring life and creating conditions for a supportive and humanist pertaining, and in which cultures (which are plural, as usual) could generate a sustainable and supportive development, in opposition to an economism. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",", Geography of communication; Ghettrification; Resilience; Smartcity",English,Book chapter,629,3,Urban Sustainability

6506739346; 57195404134,ICT'S change transport and mobility: Mind the policy gap!,2017,"In recent years both our need or desire for mobility and the opportunities and tools available to meet them have changed (and keep on changing) as a result of information and communication technologies (ICT's). ICT's have influenced both our transport modes and infrastructure as well as our behaviour. In this paper we discuss the main features of these changes and investigate how they could put public values in the transport debate in a tight corner or lead to new policy challenges. Transport comes with benefits and burdens and often a unequal distribution of both. Moreover, there are tensions between short and long term interests, public and private interests and between efficiency and equity. Analysing how new developments impact public values that are considered relevant in the transport debate shows that there is a wide range of aspects to consider. We discuss four public values. Accessibility is concerned with providing access for all, making sure there are transport options available as well as taking care that people have the capabilities to access them. Affordability or (cost) efficiency is about spending public money wisely. Availability reflects the need for a reliable transport system, today and in the future, as this is crucial for economic performance and social interaction. Acceptability is a broad category including issues with regard to justice and solidarity, the impact on safety and other external effects, the impact on the market playing field and respect for privacy. ICT's change transport in very different ways. They have changed the world of travel and traffic information, bringing more options and alternatives under people's attention. Public transport information is widely available, GPS's guide our car trips and provide real time information on traffic conditions, and platforms enable us to find a shared car or a Uber taxi fast and easy. They have enabled new forms of transport, such as new services offered through internet platforms, and probably will enable other new modes like self-driving vehicles. ICT's change our need or desire to travel and our travel experience. They change the geography of our destinations. All in all, ICT's change our behaviour in many ways, making us more flexible leading to more fragmented patterns in space and time. And with all these changes, the transport system also becomes more complex. Assessment of new developments in the transport system as a result of ICT's leads us to four major challenges, requiring policy makers to adopt a more proactive approach in order to deal with these. First, the behavioural patterns in space and time are becoming more and more whimsical and less predictable, while infrastructure such as road or rail is inherently robust, inert and takes a long time to plan and build. Yet somehow, the mice and the elephant will have to (learn to) dance together., Second, social equity is a major concern when accessibility becomes more and more dependent on privately run platforms and transport service providers using unknown algorithms. Access can be limited in multiple ways. Physical access can be an issue (service provider may shun certain neighbourhoods). However, more and more it is a matter of skills and psychological flexibility to keep up with new things (for example smart ticketing in public transport or using apps for travel information) and not everyone can cope with that. Third, there appears to be a strong 'winner-takes-it-all' tendency in the ICT sector. Tech companies become rich, powerful and unassailable, while they profit from collectively financed infrastructure (e.g. Uber). The costs for development, maintenance, education, safety etcetera are left to the public domain, as are the consequences of monopolisation, unfair competition and loss of innovation power. The question is how to price public goods and external effects properly. And fourth, robots and algorithms are quickly becoming independent actors in the transport system, while our rules and regulations are primarily made for humans and organisations. We need to think about requirements for (self-learning) software and robots such as self-driving vehicles, reflecting what moral choices we prefer in critical situations, what we want them to do for us and what not and how to deal with the liability issues that arise. © 2015 The Authors.

57192273346,Development of the U.S. green movement: Reliance on civil society,2017,"The article thoroughly analyses the history of the American Environmentalism as a socio-political movement and follows the evolvement of the early elitist Conservationist Movement into a mass Green Movement based on public participation. The importance of Conservationist principles in the U.S. state policy greatly increased during the first half of the 20th century, especially during the Progressive Era under the first President-conservationist Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909). The economic revival after the Great Depression of 1929-1933 included development of environmental and tourist infrastructure with mass participation of the civil society. However, the contemporary U. S. Green Movement was formed during and right after the World War II, as a natural consequence of the smart policy pursued by the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as part of his ""New Deal"" course. By 1970-1980s, it already included three directions: The traditional Wilderness Preservation, the Anti-Nuclear Movement and a combination Anti-Toxic Movement/Environmental-Justice Movement (known as NYMBY). Special attention is paid to its basic forms -The environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Green political parties. It is concluded that the variety of environmental NGOs - older and newer, national and local, information-And agitation-oriented, advocacy practicing and political lobbyists, etc. -Are grassroots of the environmental movement in the U.S., mobilizing civil support and creating an electoral base for Green political parties both at the state and federal level. The author investigates their present condition and perspectives, strategy and tactics of their social and political activities. At present, the popularity of ""green ideas"" in the American society is still inadequate for the Green Party U. S. to provide a real competition with the two main political parties - Democratic and Republican -At the federal level, even in view of its social-democratic orientation. However, ""The Greens"" are successful at the local level.

The problem of an insufficient marina capacity has revealed in terms of sea traffic due to the demographic structure and increasing tourism potential of Istanbul which is the biggest metropolitan city of Turkey and has around 600-km-long coastline. Therefore, the study area is mainly focused on the Marmara Sea shoreline of Istanbul. Rather than traditional methods, a rapid and cost-effective solution which considers natural and urban environment conditions is essential to satisfy the need for a marina site selection. Thanks to the latest improvements in geographic information systems, it is convenient to perform location selection analysis of marinas taking advantages of geology, land use, demography and accessibility data sets. The goal of this study is to define the areas that are appropriate for building marinas, with the use of topographic and demographic data in a present shoreline applying analytical hierarchy process multicriteria decision-making method. In this study, erosion, landslide, tsunami, land use, geologically hazardous areas, transfer lines, sea traffic data, neighbourhood scale population, age patterns and house income data have been used. Analytical hierarchy process method is used to give a weight to each data set, and a grading system has been developed for the area selection of marinas. The result maps of the analysis that show study area as classified into four categories from good to not suitable are presented.

36459545100; 57190389145,Crime prevention aspects of public space renewal in Budapest,2016,"Purpose: Security is one of the most important challenges for contemporary integrated urban developments. In Hungary, every strategic document highlights this goal, seeking social and smart city solutions to the problem. Yet, what about crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)? The purpose of the paper is to introduce a Central-European perspective into the international discussion of the topic. Design/methodology/approach: Focusing on European Union-funded renewal of public space in the historic city centre of Budapest, the research investigates how urban security can be facilitated through urban planning and design. The analysis of two projects based on design documents and interviews with actors highlights the importance of CPTED, although it is not recognised officially either in the development or in the management phase. Findings: March 15th Square is an attractive contemporary public space in the tourist-historic city centre. The project was centrally planned, executed with typical EU indicators, but without any special requirements for security. The process resulted in a safescape. By contrast, the main principal for the renewal of Teleki László Square, the first Hungarian example of community-based planning, was to instil a feeling of security. The public square became a fenced defensible space. Practical implications: The analysis method can be used for other projects evaluating changes in urban security due to public space renewal: history, requirements for security, design solutions for space division, materials and urban furniture, as well as use of space and management after the regeneration. Originality/value: The paper uncovers Hungarian cases where environmental crime prevention criteria are not explicitly but implicitly present in contemporary urban planning and design. In relation to urban security, it highlights the gap that exists among disciplines, indicative of a lack of dialogue among policymakers, researchers, designers and management. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",", Budapest; Community-based planning; Environmental crime prevention; Historic urban fabric; Public space renewal; Urban security",English,Article,293,3,Urban Sustainability
57189463535; 36621768300; 56865804400,City smartNESS: The energy dimension of the urban system,2016,"This paper proposes a re-thought of the concept of urban smartness, particularly referring to the energy component. Recognizing that the new technologies, which are the most popular aspect of smartness, can play a fundamental role in the new approach, it has been suggested that we consider them in an adoptive way rather than in an adjunctive way, as it is commonly intended in the general sense of a smart city. According to this vision, in the first part of the paper, a new concept of smartness is proposed (SmartNESS: Smart New Energy Saving System). This concept is also related to the possibility of identifying some leading urban functions that can play a strategic role in improving urban smartness. In this sense, in the second part, tourism is considered as a drive function able to make cities more efficient and attractive if it will be integrated inside the urban governance process. The third part of the paper highlights how the rationalization and reduction of energy consumption is one of the essential fields to rely on in order to improve the smartness of a city. This part provides an overview of the most significant initiatives that are being developed on energy efficiency, and investigates some cases particularly innovative addressing the issue with an integrated and non-sectorial approach. Through the analyzed experiences, some possible intervention strategies to integrate the issues of energy efficiency in urban planning are suggested in the conclusive part of the paper. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",", Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Energy components; Intervention strategy; New approaches; New energies; Strategic role; Urban governance; Urban systems; Tourism",English,Article,248,3,Urban Sustainability

The study took 83 indicators as its starting point, identifying and classifying 29 key indicators as the methodology was developed. These are grouped under the following headings: water management, agriculture and livestock farming, forestry, health, the energy sector, industry, services and commerce, tourism, town planning and housing, mobility and transport infrastructures, research, development and innovation. The subsequent statistical analysis of these 29 indicators, with the assistance of the Catalan Institute for the Evaluation of Public Policies (Ivàlua), produced a global adaptation indicator quantifying Catalonia’s capacity to adapt to climate change impacts. This global indicator is based on two factors: use of resources and environmental quality. Effectively, capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change depends on how we use resources (primarily water and energy) and on the quality of the environment (primarily air quality). The global indicator allows a country’s capacity to adapt to climate change to be monitored over time. The absolute value of the indicator (from 0 to 10) dropped slightly between 2005 and 2011. Catalonia is working on the issue, but must continue to make every effort to improve the extent to which we are adapting to ensure that our land, natural systems and society are progressively less vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In developing this indicator, Catalonia has a tool which provides guidance on where to focus efforts towards developing a green, circular, low-carbon economy which is adaptable to the new conditions brought about by climate change.

Despite such development, limited studies have examined their geospatial or tourism characteristics reducing marketing and managerial efficacy. To address this gap, this study measured six geospatial and tourism attributes of nine wine trails in North Carolina (USA) toward a characterization of TTRs. Results indicated a shared low Connectivity and good Accessibility among study wine trails regardless of their spatial patterns. Tourism-wise, services provided were Comprehensive within wine trails and Complementary across wineries. Results provided managerial intelligence to existing wine trails, such as the need to enhance local road network density and outbalance tourism dominance within trails.

26639369100,Reaching destination on time with cooperative intelligent transportation systems,2016,"Research on intelligent transportation systems is so far focussed on decreasing the travel time of vehicles and avoiding congestions. However, the importance of reaching on time is different for different vehicles and depends upon the purpose of the journey. In a human-operated queue, it is generally considered courteous to give priority to people running very late. They may be running late to catch a flight or may be in an emergency for a medical check-up. There is a very small discomfort to the other people as long as the number of people in an emergency and running late is low. However, such prioritization is an invaluable help to the people running late. In this paper the same behaviour is modelled, wherein the transportation system is made biased towards the vehicles on an important task and running late. The paper presents the mechanism by which a vehicle may judge its running status, decide whether to ask for cooperation and decide how much of cooperation to ask for. The vehicle lane changes and traffic lights operating policy are made cooperative. Experimental results show that such a cooperation leads to lesser number of important vehicles reaching their destinations late. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Intelligent systems; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Cooperative ITS; Cooperative overtaking; Intelligent transportation systems; Number of peoples; Operating policies; Prioritization; Routing; Transportation system; Intelligent vehicle highway systems, cooperative ITS; cooperative overtaking; intelligent transportation systems; routing; start time computation",English,Article,203,4,Mobility and Transportation

The book introduces an innovative evaluation approach, namely Territorial Integrated Evaluation (TIE), a meta-evaluation methodology for designing regional development scenarios. A research team from the Politecnico di Torino applied this methodology experimentally to the practices of spatial planning in Trentino in order to aid the Province in a process of institutional innovation that is still going on today. TIE defines territorial scenarios serving the need for regional economic development as well as the conservation of nature and landscape. A cross-border region, Trentino has a special need to harmonize economic development with the exceptional and internationally renowned value of its landscape which includes the Dolomites, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Therefore TIE set out to design regional development scenarios that integrated various topics - retail, tourism, infrastructures, nature and landscape. By testing out TIE in practice in this extraordinarily dynamic institutional context, the book makes a significant contribution to the discussion about newly emerging approaches to spatial planning that involve multidisciplinary vision, new paradigms in regional development, and institutional learning and capability in decision-making. © Grazia Brunetta 2015.

Transnational strategies to face marine pollution with oil spills and hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) have been under development in different regions.

We move away from the notion of zonal accessibility and measure fine-grained accessibility using door-to-door travel times. Two pedestrian networks are compared to a baseline scenario considering Euclidean distances for a large metropolitan area in which each individual building is considered as an activity opportunity. It is shown that pedestrian accessibility to jobs differs when pedestrian distances are approximated with different networks that are more representative of reality. Stop-to-stop public transport travel times are extracted from an agent-based simulation of public transport smart card data. The effect of less-than-optimal connections from transit to the pedestrian network, a local measurement, can be seen when calculating the accessibility to all destinations in the city. We suggest moving away from Euclidean-based distance analyses. Limitations can be found in the data available; the connection of buildings to the network becomes important, as does the inclusion of pedestrian crossings. For an inclusive accessibility measure, it will be necessary to calculate generalized costs for pedestrians and generate different pedestrian networks that reflect the limitations of different user groups. © 2015 Michael A.B. van Eggermond and Alex Erath.",", Micro-level; Network generation; Object-fine; Pedestrian accessibility; Transit accessibility",English,Article,203,4,Mobility and Transportation
56998611700; 56737176000,A decision support tool for evaluating decision options for out-bound flight delays considering high-valuable passengers,2016,"Introduction: Though studies show that arriving on-time is the service characteristic most valued by the air passengers and passenger service coordinators are consulted in the operation disruptions, passengers rarely drive operational decision-making in the disruption management of an airline. Taking into consideration airlines’ seeking the prevention of losing passengers’ goodwill in situations where the level of service quality (SQ) performed is not as high as the promoted one, this research is focused particularly on an influence of delayed connecting (or in-bound) high-fare passengers on making decisions on onward delays. Operationally seen, connecting passengers are of a particular importance for airlines, since they are already involved in their operations-flow, while becoming in this way the third most important airlines’ aspect of operations, succeeding aircraft and crew. On the other hand, exclusive travellers such as first class and elite-status, contracted corporate members, and business passengers are considered as the high-valuable passengers, who are enough (financially) worth to the airline, particularly for to be waited for if they are delayed in arriving with an in-bound flight. Based upon an examination made from the airlines’ operational point of view and for determined prioritization strategy, a Decision Support System (DSS) tool, named DEVOTED DSS Tool, for use in the disruption management of the Airline Operation Control Centre (AOCC) is presented. For assisting the airline operation controllers in decisions on whether to delay the departure of out-bound flights in order to wait for arriving-delayed high-fare passengers from an in-bound flight, an influence of these passengers’ satisfaction on making decisions on onward delays, the passenger segmentation per flight, associated consequences in terms of the Level of Service (LOS) performed by the carrier and the one perceived by the passengers, as well as the accompanying costs are taken into account. Methods: The designed tool incorporates the key elements of Human-Centred Design (HCD) relying on a multi-criteria algorithm making-up its decision making process for evaluation of decision options and making suggestion. Being scenario-driven and knowledge-based the tool implements the airline prioritisation policies. Hereby, the level of service quality delivered by the air carrier and the level of service quality expected and perceived by the high-fare passengers are determined quantitatively by employing a created LOS-model which relies on the basic categorization rules of the Kano’s quality model. Results: For testing of the tool, two scheduled airlines with two different prioritization strategies and operating on the same flight route between the same origin-destination airports (i.e. city-pairs) are taken. Though the testing is real-world data based, in order to expose a tangible aim and capabilities of the designed tool, the testing scenarios are constructed in such a way to reflect specific borderline operational situations, while emphasizing occurring conflicting decision key criteria. The tool output consists of two components – the LOS quality delivered by the carrier including the delay-costs (LOS Airline) and the level of service perceived by the high-fare passengers on both flights (LOS Passenger) – which are reflected on the user interface in form of two bars, each consisting of three colours indicating an option as good (green), neutral (yellow) or bad (red). Although the operation controller may take the opposite decision as recommended, the tool is enabled to display the evaluation of consequences of any decision made, while being visualized as a scale-value positioned somewhere on the three- colour-bar. Conclusion: Investigating the impact of a passenger-structure on decisions on onward-delays in the every-day flight operations execution, a decision support real-time tool, DelayingVIPsOriented DecisionSupportSystem (DEVOTED DSS) was created, implementing (pre-specified) airline prioritisation policy in accordance with the rating of the high-fare passengers-classes importance. The decision solutions’ consequences displayed in the designed form are practical in terms of user-friendly utilization of DEVOTED and are simple and easy to deal with, since being relieved of any digits, data and/or calculations. Aiming at accurately evaluating the impact of operational disruption-decisions on the high-fare passengers, DEVOTED processes the LOS quality which is to be delivered to these passengers, SQ-attributes required/expected by these passengers, number of passengers in each defined passenger-group and the ticket prices purchased, as well as expected costs. For the first time, an introduced juxtaposition of the in-bound and out-bound high-fare passengers of the same cabin-class within connecting flights has been employed as an influencing factor in the decision making process of the airline disruption management. When it is about to make the choice between a monetary benefit and the retention of the reputation of a reliable service provider, the use of the designed tool affords rather objective instead the still occurring intuitive decision making in such disruptions. © 2015, The Author(s).","Air traffic control; Air transportation; Artificial intelligence; Costs; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Fighter aircraft; Knowledge based systems; Quality of service; Traffic control; Transportation; User interfaces; Airline operations; Decision making process; Decision support system (dss); Decision support tools; Disruption management; Level of Service; Operational decision making; Service characteristics; Decision making, Decision making at AOCC; DSS tool for airline disruption management; High-fare passengers in airline operations; Quantifying level of service",English,Article,760,4,Mobility and Transportation

CAP is the use of automated electric vehicles using smart navigation and control technologies to improve mass transportation. In CAP, common vehicles are used by different passengers, thus, reducing the on-road traffic and also the parking space required. Various low-cost stations are to be built along specified paths and the vehicle can be used at the convenience of the commuter. Currently, buses and trains require the passengers to wait at the station and a significant amount of time is spent at intermediate stops. The vehicle in CAP runs directly from origin to destination and also eliminates the waiting time at stations. Passengers do not wait for vehicles; instead vehicles wait for the passengers. The journey starts as the passenger enters the station and selects the destination. The tracks can be built using the current infrastructure with some modifications, thus, reducing the infrastructure costs. Capacities of vehicles vary from two to twenty or more seats. CAP will reduce the carbon emissions, save the driving efforts, increase land utilization by reduction in parking space and reduce the number of accidents; providing a safe, quick, reliable, eco-friendly means of transportation. © 2016 SAE International.",", Accidents; Automobiles; Electric machine control; Carbon emissions; Eco-friendly; Infrastructure costs; Land utilization; Means of transportations; Navigation and control; Parking spaces; Waiting-time; Mass transportation",English,Conference paper,207,4,Mobility and Transportation

The study was conducted by searching published literature and electronic resources and by reaching out to professionals working for foreign local, regional, and national jurisdictions for up-to-date information on innovative plans, policies, practices, and designs. This report covers treatments and practices from a total of 11 countries. Based on information gleaned from the study, the team identified six thematic areas, with four covering infrastructure or treatments: (1) network infrastructure (including large-scale intersection design), (2) limited auto traffic areas, (3) signalization, traffic control, and intelligent transport systems, and (4) policy change; and two topic areas focusing on innovations in: (1) methods or measures for prioritizing improvements, and (2) goals and network performance measures. In addition, the team identified and summarized a few recent guidance documents. Finally, information on network outcomes is summarized, including an example of recent findings and actions resulting from national safety monitoring and evaluations of innovative treatments. A number of treatments and practices appear to have significant potential for use in the United States (U.S.), particularly for completing and expanding bicycle networks to enable longer and safer trips with less delay. Note that not all of the covered treatments are considered particularly innovative. Some of the most interesting things that are happening internationally are improving on prior successes (e.g., going from separated bike lanes-typically called cycle tracks in Europe-to bicycle superhighways), studying the effects of past innovations, and designating clear and ambitious mobility goals, which in turn lead to active strategies to retrofit space and provide other improvements to meet bicyclist and pedestrian needs. One of the key lessons from international jurisdictions with high levels of walking and bicycling and good safety records, is that bicycling and walking are clearly prioritized in plan goals, which, as expressed through broad performance measures, are seen as having value to help achieve public health, environmental, livability, economic, and transport sustainability goals, as well as providing transportation options in their own right. Therefore, project and decision criteria reflect greater priority to make bicycle and pedestrian travel safer, faster, and more convenient, even if changes sometimes may hinder motor vehicle mobility or access. The ambitious pedestrian and bicycle mobility goals established by many foreign jurisdictions can only be achieved if the networks provide safe and convenient choices and are perceived as such by potential users. A variety of criteria and formal and informal processes are used to assess whether networks and facilities are meeting network goals and how they can be improved. Processes used include leveraging staff expertise, performing quality assessments, examining complaint data, applying risk indexes to develop priorities, applying a broader goal or policy framework (including safety principles and design guidance criteria), and gathering input from the public (including a from broad array of potential roadway users) and from bike unions. Public input seems to be highly valued and used by most jurisdictions, and some take proactive measures to gather input directly from the community. For example, in one city, staff cycle to meetings, ride the network (sometimes using a variety of bike types), and attend community meetings to listen to concerns. Other cities regularly perform formal surveys of users. Some jurisdictions have used bicycle unions and tools to help assess their networks. Further study is needed to clarify the processes used, how widely they are used and in what combinations, and which might work best in the U.S.to help create a more representative and equitable decision process. The types of infrastructure and network completion measures identified as most promising for U.S. practitioners to examine further include the following: ● Various types of bicycle priority streets (superhighways, shared bicycle priority streets, wider separated lanes, and “green waves”) for longer cycle trips and improving connections to employment and urban centers. Some communities have planned extensive networks of connected facilities linking important origins (outlying areas and cities) to important destinations. Overpasses, underpasses, and grade separated junctions are frequently used to bypass major roads and other barriers such as rivers and canals. ● Lower-speed, experimental designs for multi-lane, at-grade roundabouts and their approaches to help bicyclists safely travel through. ● Path or lane lighting (energy-efficient) for nighttime use, using technologies to detect users and raise the lighting and then dim the lighting as the user moves away. ● Bicycle signals and various measures for bicycle priority at intersections, including: ● “Green waves” signal progression. ● More green time for bicyclists. ● More split phasing to separate conflicting motor vehicle and bicycle movements ● Allowing non-conflicting bicycle through movements (bicycle green) when signal is red for parallel motorized traffic. ● Leading bicycle interval/head start. ● Path or two-way bicycle facility priority at junctions with low-volume streets. ● Traffic restricted, pedestrian priority zones. In summary, there are a number of planning and decision processes and innovative infrastructure treatments that have potential for use in the U.S. These include setting ambitious mobility goals and identifying formal or informal methods to assess public and user satisfaction and desires. These procedures might potentially be as simple as getting staff and decision-makers to bike or walk more often in more areas, but may also include more formalized processes to gather a better cross-section of public concerns and input into the planning and prioritization process. Most of the infrastructure innovations are expanding on ideas that have been working well and improving on designs and traffic controls to further enhance safety and mobility. Some of the ideas may have significant potential for improving bicycle and pedestrian safety and mobility in the U.S. if well implemented. Additional study is needed to better understand and facilitate the best ideas and test and refine them for use by U.S. jurisdictions. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,English,Book chapter,978,4,Mobility and Transportation
57191526286,Theoretical Method for Building OD Matrix from AFC Data,2016,"The smart cards conquered a serious space in the traffic in the past years. The cards are used like an automatic fare collection system by the different public transport companies. The fare collection is easier, faster and last but not least more efficient with this method. However the generated data are utilizable for other aims apart from the original aim. The origin-destination matrix plays a key role in a transport company's life. We may adapt to the travel demands efficiently in the knowledge of the matrix. Thanks to the proper service the passengers will be satisfied, and they use the service with pleasure. The additional benefit, that the unnecessary capacities can be forced back in the knowledge of the demand, and thereby the expenses of the service provider's decrease. The origin-destination matrix was able to create only with classical counting and interview methods till now. Their disadvantage, that the production consumes considerable workforce and time with a method like this, and hereby the costs are higher. The counting concern to a given time only and the sampling proportion compared to the number of travels of the year is quite slight. Because of that the distortion effect is considerable, the matrix cannot reflect the effects of an intervention. These effects get into the system only after the next counting. The penetration of the smart cards increases, the card user passengers' number increases continuously. Thanks to that, not only the cost efficiency of the fare collection is growing, but at the same time the statistical sample size too. If more passengers from young persons to older ones accept the usage of the cards, we may receive more accurate picture about the transportation network. If the fare collection system was built up somewhere, the origin-destination matrix can be manufactured with lower expenses, and because of the continuous usage the matrix will be current always, the changes become traceable. We may know the demands in all the moments, the origin-destination matrix may change dynamically in function of the weather, time of the day, season and so on. The check-out data can be manufactured from exclusively check in data with different algorithms. The passenger's boarding and alighting places become known on the given route.

Nine practices were implemented by a moderate to high percentage of respondents. Over time, implementation of six practices significantly differed, with increases in five practices and a decrease in one.

Sludge quantity conspicuously increased in the last years, and it may be considered without any doubt as a very interesting substrate for energetic valorization processes. Therefore the investigation of sludge incineration through the here proposed methodology applied to a significant case study, such as a WWTP treating 2.7 M p.e. organic load, maybe useful for EU highly populated contexts operating centralized urban water systems. In fact, although anaerobic digestion and composting are still the most commonly adopted solutions for sludge management even in large WWTPs, the introduction of a sludge-to-energy approach will be mandatory in the next future. The first step of the implemented approach consisted in a baseline analysis, which was necessary to define the main qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the sludge. Afterwards a detailed hypothesis about a potential plant configuration was formulated, considering its feasibility from the technological and economic point of view and the environmental drawbacks as well. The proposed methodology was validated taking into account the sludge deriving from the largest Italian WWTP (inflow 200,000,000 m3/y of civil and industrial wastewater). The amount of generated sludge is approximately 100,000 t/y (38.9% DS) and after anaerobic digestion it is destined to centrifugation, filtration and thermal drying. The circumstance that the mentioned processes are performed on a full-scale, together with an extended characterization of the generated outflows, allowed a sound investigation of the effect of pre-treatments on thermal valorization of the sludge. An economic evaluation of the incineration proposal showed that the final cost of the sludge disposal would be of about 63–65 Euro/t for the considered case study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Economic analysis; Heat treatment; Incineration; Sewers; Sludge disposal; Waste disposal; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Economic evaluations; Energy recovery; Industrial wastewaters; Quantitative characteristics; Sludge; Sludge-to-energy; Urban water systems; Wastewater treatment plants; Sludge digestion, Energy recovery; Incineration; Sludge; Sludge-to-energy; Thermal treatment",English,Article,291,3,Urban Sustainability

In this paper, we use the observed behaviour of a subset of metro users in Singapore, who are willing to travel a longer time (into the opposite direction or backwards) to secure a seat for the actual trip in the direction towards their destination. We use smart card transactions to estimate the share of users who are willing to travel in the opposite direction during the first part of their trip and the average train occupancy per section to estimate differences in the valuation of travel time sitting and standing - translated into a standing multiplier or standing premium, which is analogous to the crowding multiplier that is usually found in the crowding valuation literature.

Studying the reasonable construction methods of the wetland park is very important for its sustainable development. In this paper, a wetland park with an area of 173.5 hectares located in Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, China is taken as an example to show how to apply the concepts and measures of resource saving and environment friendliness to the three development phases of planning, construction and management of the park. Measures of resource saving include land conservation, water resource conservation, energy conservation, vegetation optimization, application of low carbon construction techniques, indigenous materials and intelligent technologies used in management. Environment friendly measures include development intensity control, man-made wetland construction, friendly materials adoption, fibre resource using wooden plank, road building on stilts, topsoil and native vegetation protection during construction, noise control, pesticide usage reduction in management, bio-safety disposal of garbage and tourists capacity control.

It has been established that the largest cash flow from investments is generated by enterprises engaged in agricultural production and processing, as well as high-tech enterprises. A survey of the most efficient agricultural enterprises shows that the most competitive and profitable ones are those that have been restructured based on innovative forms of organization and management and innovative technologies in basic production processes. In the structure of innovative development, the authors identify innovations that use information and communication technologies (ICT). It is shown that these technologies provide the basis for the ongoing convergence of modern innovations in the economy of the Northern Caucasus. This is particularly characteristic of services provided to the public. For example, the tourism industry has been developing with positive revenue growth due to the emergence of online aggregators presented in the Web services market by companies engaged in integrating travel services. First, they promote the services of tour operators, and second, they perform the function of logistic integration. As logistics hubs, they initiate flows of financial and other resources through systems of online orders and payments. Significant progress has been made in road transport services. In this market segment, a decisive role is played by online taxi booking services Yandex. taxi, GetTaxi (Gett), and others. They have provided innovative technological solutions using mobile gadgets and applications, which significantly increase the market penetration of innovative forms of services. In agricultural production in the Northern Caucasus, a new driver of revenue growth is workflow automation based on innovative smart firmware devices. They enable rational situational decision making based on real-time measurement and analysis of production processes. Such management leads to a significant increase in crop yields with a simultaneous reduction in costs. In our view, the intellectual skills of personnel who service innovative equipment are of fundamental importance in this context. The formation of human capital with a higher intellectual level requires the development of the education system and investment in institutions for advance training of personnel and the development of new competencies. This helps to create a system with positive feedback, self-regulation and development. The stability of system relationships in the economy of the Northern Caucasus has stood the test of the crises of 2008- 2009 and 2014-2015. Consequently, the established innovative development trend should also be seen as fundamental for government agencies responsible for the development strategy of the Northern Caucasus and investment in its infrastructure. © 2016, CA and CC Press AB.

The first upgrading (1) proposes the separated thickening: primary sludge is thickened by gravity while dynamic thickening is applied to secondary sludge. The second upgrading (2) introduces a post-aerobic digestion stage (after the anaerobic one), in addition to separate thickening. Technical-economic and environmental assessments have been performed in comparison to a conventional wastewater treatment plant, which operates with gravity thickening and anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge. In the post-aerobic stage, operated with intermittent aeration, additional volatile solids removal of 45% and nitrification and denitrification efficiencies of 97% and 70%, respectively, were achieved. Both upgrading alternatives gained a positive technical evaluation with the only exceptions of the item ""Thermal energy consumption"" in upgrading 1 for agricultural reuse, and, to a minor extent, the ""Energy available for external recovery"" for incineration in both upgrading options. Cost analysis showed that the two upgrading alternatives are generally cheaper than the conventional plant, even if the results are dependent on local conditions, which have to be considered. Results of the environmental assessment showed that the upgrades with incineration perform better than the reference for all impact categories except freshwater eutrophication, with upgrading 2 as the best option. For the agricultural use, different results were obtained for the different impact categories with critical aspects mainly related to phosphorus and ammonia emissions for upgrading 1. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Public transport origin-destination (O-D) estimation is a significant product of processing smart card data. In recent years, various O-D estimation methods using the trip-chaining approach have attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. However, the validity of these estimation methods has not been extensively investigated. This is mainly because these datasets usually lack data about passengers' alighting, as passengers are often required to tap their smart cards only when boarding a public transport service. Thus, this paper has two main objectives. First, the paper reports on the implementation and validation of the existing O-D estimation method using the unique smart card dataset of the South-East Queensland public transport network which includes data on both boarding stops and alighting stops. Second, the paper improves the O-D estimation algorithm and empirically examines these improvements, relying on this unique dataset. The evaluation of the last destination assumption of the trip-chaining method shows a significant negative impact on the matching results of the differences between actual boarding/alighting times and the public transport schedules. The proposed changes to the algorithm improve the average distance between the actual and estimated alighting stops, as this distance is reduced from 806 m using the original algorithm to 530 m after applying the suggested improvements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Australia; Queensland; Smart cards; Estimation algorithm; Estimation methods; Original algorithms; Public transport; Public transport networks; Public transport service; Trip-chaining method; Validation; algorithm; data set; estimation method; public transport; Data handling, O-D estimation; Public transport smart card fare data; Trip-chaining method; Validation",English,Article,228,4,Mobility and Transportation
57212062094,An evaluation of the police response to gang-related violence and future security threats,2016,"Over the past decade Bermuda has experienced a dramatic increase in gang violence. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s Global Study on Murder showed that Bermuda’s murder rate had increased from 3.1 per 100,000 people in 2003 to 12.5 in 2011 (Strangeways in The Royal Gazette, 2010). While the increased prevalence of gangs is not something that is unique to Bermuda (Bullock and Tilley in Shootings, gangs and violent incidents in Manchester: developing a crime reduction strategy. Home Office, London, 2002; Battin-Pearson et al. in Gang membership, delinquent peers, and delinquent behavior. Youth Gang Series. Washington, 1998), the sharp increase was a cause of great concern within the local community, the police and politicians (Parliamentary Joint Select Committee in a parliamentary joint select committee publication under part IV of the Parliamentary Act 1957, 2011). The reason for this may be that Bermuda’s economy relies largely on tourism (Central Intelligence Agency in The World Factbook. The Central Intelligence Agency, 2013) and international business, especially reinsurance, which increased its presence on the island since the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on the 11th of September 2001. Any increase of gang violence in an otherwise peaceful and low crime country may deter future investment in the island (Washington Post in Gang violence jolts formerly quiet Bermuda; tourist getaway grapples with string of shootings, 2006). This research primarily seeks to outline the development of Bermuda’s gang culture and how the Bermuda Police Service (BPS) responded to the gang violence. It has been suggested that gang-related crime is essentially a social problem and not just an undertaking for the police, but the community as a whole (Muncie in Crime Justice Matters 34:4–5, 1999). Socio-economic factors may have also influenced the development of gang crime in Bermuda, but this research focuses on the situational crime prevention strategies that the BPS adopted and whether these strategies have helped to reduce gang violence, and whether the techniques used may be considered suitable in preventing a rise in terrorism. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",", Bermuda; Gang-related violence; Policing; Terrorism",English,Book chapter,340,3,Urban Sustainability

Public planning and funding face critical limitations, such as: (i) not duly accounting for the induced pressures on inland transportation infrastructure allowing access from/to the port to/from interesting trade links/destinations; (ii) not duly accounting for indirect costs and benefits resulting from either new infrastructural developments or re-deployment of existing infrastructures, and (iii) not duly accounting for the impacts of ports on the cities in which they are localised. Fragmented projections and impact assessments lead to sub-optimal economic performance of multi-modal terminals, the transportation network and the area they impact on increasing the risk of depleting initial investments or requiring on-going/permanent - public support, including to overcome local negative impacts. This article has two main purposes. On the one hand, it strives to identify shortcomings that hinder the achievement of expected benefits on urban and regional growth linked to port activity expansion. It is not based on a comprehensive analysis of case studies but on literature review and for that reason limiting factors mentioned in the article are not necessarily suited to specific situations. On the other hand, the article proposes a reflection on the relevant analytical and policy intervention tools having the potential to tackle and - ideally - resolve shortcomings. It advocates that a wider use of such tools would enhance the efficiency of handling freight volumes through ports and onto surface transport corridors maximizing positive spillover effects while minimizing nuisances and drawbacks for the urban and regional areas concerned. Congestion reduction in and around port areas and enhanced competitiveness are the expected results from balanced multimodal transport solutions. Many benefits are associated with efficient ports yet there tends to be a mismatch with gains spilling over to other regions and negative impacts borne locally. This area of research is expected to become all the more relevant in view of growing size of ships and therefore reduced number of ports/operators capable of handling those as well as higher induced pressure on - often already congested - inland transportation corridors. Conversely, development of the Motorways of the Sea and implementation of Short Sea Shipping foresee the increased use of medium and small ports to relieve the heavy burden on land transport, but this implies revised shipping patterns as well as overcoming fragmentation in transport infrastructure planning. © 2016 The Authors.",", governance; growth; hinterland; impacts; multi-modal transportation; ports; transportation network",English,Conference paper,436,4,Mobility and Transportation

In rural tourism, a growing niche in the tourism market, multiple components of environmental constructs play a crucial role in contributing to the sustainability and competitiveness of rural tourism destinations. Hence, this study examines the impact of environment components on development of rural tourism destination competitiveness from a local community perspective. In addition, community support was adopted as moderator variable to examine the relationship among the constructs. 299 respondents comprising of residents of rural tourism in Sarawak, Malaysia took part voluntarily in this study. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Version 21.0 and Smart PLS 2.0 (M3) to assess the developed model, based on path modelling and then bootstrapping.

Comparison of transit origin-destination estimates with automatic fare collection data,2016,"There is a consensus on the importance and value of automatic fare collection (AFC) data in analysing different aspects of public transport. As such combining other data sources such as the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) can greatly improve the quality of the analyses and ultimately provide a better understanding of public transport performance. This paper presents a methodology for data processing and analysis to acquire a public transport Origin Destination (OD) matrix. The case study uses a very large dataset on passenger boarding and alighting of all three transit modes, namely bus, rail and ferry, in South-East Queensland (SEQ). The OD trip matrices are estimated for both the AM and PM peak periods for five weekdays. Also, the estimated public transport demands for the same periods from the SEQ strategic transport model (SEQSTM) are employed. This approach enables not only the comparison of OD matrices over time to determine changes in travel patterns but also investigates the similarity between the demands from the SEQSTM procedure and those from AFC data. A number of statistical measures, namely R2, GEH, %RMSE and an eigenvalue-based measure, are utilized to determine the level of similarity of these OD matrices. The results highlight the similarity of the trip pattern between four workdays (Mon-Thu). However, trip patterns on a Friday are slightly different from the other weekdays, particularly in the PM peak period. Also, the demand from SEQSTM for both time periods is not analogous to any of the AFC patterns. © 2016 ATRF, Commonwealth of Australia.

57194131073,Monitoring some smart city geographical characteristics of medina in Saudi Arabia,2016,"“Smart City” has grown as an important field of study, that relates especially to the future sustainable development of cities. There was a large number of attempts to formulate a more comprehensive and accurate concept to the smart city during the past years, focusing on the development of both place and people. Nevertheless, studies still lack in similar topics on Medina city. This paper aims mainly at exposing and analyzing some smart city geographical characteristics of Medina (a famous city in Saudi Arabia) with its important reputation of religious tourism in the Middle East and the Islamic world as a whole. It begins with the standpoint of reviewing some definitions of “Smart City” and its main axes to assess some of its geographical properties measurable or observable. Then, it demonstrates elements that ait as defects to the city development towards smartness.

This way, there is a need to develop more efficient and inexpensive methods of collecting information about citizens' travel patterns. In this line, this paper presents a generic methodology that allows to infer the origin and destination zones for an observed trip between two public transport stops (i.e., bus stops or metro stations) using socio-economic, land use, and network information. The proposed zonal inference model follows a disaggregated Logit approach including size variables. The model enables the estimation of a zonal origin-destination matrix for a city, if trip information passively collected by a smart-card payment system is available (in form of a stop-to-stop matrix). The methodology is applied to the Santiago de Chile's morning peak period, with the purpose of serving as input for a public transport planning computational tool. To estimate the model, information was gathered from different sources and processed into a unified framework; data included a survey conducted at public transport stops, land use information, and a stop-to-stop trip matrix. Additionally, a zonal system with 1176 zones was constructed for the city, including the definition of its access links and associated distances. Our results shows that, ceteris paribus, zones with high numbers of housing units have higher probabilities of being the origin of a morning peak trip. Likewise, health facilities, educational, residential, commercial, and offices centres have significant attraction powers during this period. In this sense, our model manages to capture the expected effects of land use on trip generation and attraction. This study has numerous policy implications, as the information obtained can be used to predict the impacts of changes in the public transport network (such as extending routes, relocating their stops, designing new routes or changing the fare structure). Further research is needed to improve the zonal inference formulation and origin-destination matrix estimation, mainly by including better cost measures, and dealing with survey and data limitations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Chile; Metropolitana; Santiago [Metropolitana]; Economics; Housing; Land use; Matrix algebra; Public policy; Smart cards; Subway stations; Surveys; Transportation routes; Zoning; Network information; Origin and destinations; Origin destination matrices; Origin-destination matrix estimation; Policy implications; Public transport; Public transport networks; Smartcard datum; modeling; public transport; transportation planning; Information use, Origin-destination matrix; Public transport; Smartcard data; Zoning system",English,Article,330,4,Mobility and Transportation

55929210800; 7005545491,"Perth (Australia) as one of the world's most liveable cities: a perspective on society, sustainability and environment",2015,"Purpose: – Rankings of the world's cities by a liveability factor have become increasingly significant in the media, among governments and city councils in the promotion of cities, as well as academics interested in understanding the impact of quantifying liveability on urban planning and the relationship of liveability indices and tourism. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: – While examining characteristics of liveable cities according to some of the widely reported liveability indices, such as those produced by Mercer, Monocle magazine and the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), the authors provide a snapshot of Perth as a liveable city and consider liveability in relation to urban tourism, sustainability and environment. Perth's liveability ranking is discussed in terms of environmental sustainability, noting that for Perth to retain its position as one of the world's most liveable cities, consideration must be given to sustainable planning and environmental practices at policy, organisational and individual levels, placing the long-term liveability of the environment and Perth's flora and fauna at the forefront of urban, and tourism, planning. Findings: – The accessibility of nature in Perth and its surrounds, its outdoor recreational opportunities and warm climate are factors that make it unique. Developing and promoting nature-based tourism would further enhance the accessibility of nature for visitors and residents. While Perth's EIU top ten ranking is justified, its major attributes remain unrecognised by the widely used EIU liveable city assessment framework. Research limitations/implications: – Moreover, the notion of a liveable city is open to contention due to the subjective nature of various assessment criteria. Liveability indices should include quantifiable environmental factors such as green space, remnant vegetation, biodiversity, air quality and unpolluted water. Originality/value: – This paper thus contributes to the discourse on what constitutes a liveable city, the authors emphasise that liveability is significantly related to the presence of green space and natural areas as well as the opportunity to see and interact with wildlife. Perth has such opportunities for it residents and visitors but as yet the aforementioned natural characteristics are not implicit in international measures of liveability. © 2015,.",", Environment; Liveable cities; Perth; Sustainability; Urban planning; Urban tourism",English,Article,346,11,Rural Resource Management

Transit agencies can raise revenue or relieve overcrowding via fare increases, but they are always confronted with the possibility of heavy ridership losses. Therefore, the outcome of fare changes should be evaluated before implementation. In this work, a methodology was formulated based on elasticity and exhaustive transit card data, and a network approach was proposed to assess the influence of distance-based fare increases on ridership and revenue. The approach was applied to a fare change plan for Beijing Metro. The price elasticities of demand for Beijing Metro at various fare levels and trip distances were tabulated from a stated preference survey. Trip data recorded by an automatic fare collection system was used alongside the topology of the Beijing Metro system to calculate the shortest path lengths between all station pairs, the origin-destination matrix, and trip lengths. Finally, three fare increase alternatives (high, medium, and low) were evaluated in terms of their impact on ridership and revenue. The results demonstrated that smart card data have great potential with regard to fare change evaluation. According to smart card data for a large transit network, the statistical frequency of trip lengths is more highly concentrated than that of the shortest path length. Moreover, the majority of the total trips have a length of around 15. km, and these are the most sensitive to fare increases. Specific attention should be paid to this characteristic when developing fare change plans to manage demand or raise revenue. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Beijing [China]; China; Elasticity; Graph theory; Networks (circuits); Smart cards; Demand; Fare change; Impact evaluation; Metro; Origin destination matrices; Stated preference surveys; Statistical frequency; Trip distances; demand elasticity; discrete choice analysis; metro system; optimization; planning method; transportation planning; travel demand; Subways, Demand; Fare change; Metro; Network; Smart card data; Trip distance",English,Article,254,4,Mobility and Transportation

57189329495; 55942300300,Maritime governance - Differences between assumptions and realizations,2016,"The goal for Europe 2020 is smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The source of such growth is inter alia and maritime economy. Although maritime transport is the largest portion of the maritime economy, other sectors are favoured more in the pursuit of sustainable growth. The aforementioned sectors consist of: aquaculture, coastal tourism, marine biotechnology, ocean energy, and seabed mining. All of the activities listed above demand one key driver: human resources accompanied by proper marine experience. Unfortunately the shortage of maritime officers which began a few years ago has been steadily worsening. Many organizers (e.g. International Maritime Organization), institutions (e.g. the European Union) and governments have taken actions to reduce the scale of the shortage but the results up to this point have been unsatisfactory. This paper refers to the governance and the ideas created on the international, regional, and national levels in light of the actions taken by maritime training institutions (especially universities). The authors studied documents prepared by various institutions on different levels devoted to solving the shortage of human resources. They also checked what level of involvement the university educated officers had in the process. The first part of research focused on the official documents, the second one - on the survey. The research was undertaken in Poland at the Gdynia Maritime University (GMU) and at the Croatian University of Dubrovnik (UD). They were based on a survey with closed and semi-closed questions. The main questions were: • How do young people find out about maritime studies? • Who inspired them to take maritime studies? • Are maritime studies their first choice? • What do they know about the work and living on the sea? The results show that the goals of governance institutions and expectations of universities are divergent. Realization of Blue Growth and Europe 2020 Strategies demand well-educated, highly qualified human resources. The maritime universities need just students. The results of research show that: • Less than 10% respondents decided to study at GMU and at UD due to promotional activities undertaken by both universities. • 34% of Polish and 23% of Croatian students chose their studies under influence of their family or friends. • For 16% of students (both nationalities) maritime studies weren't the first choice of studies. • The image that students had of their future work in the maritime field was far off from reality. The research findings reveal the differences between the goals of governance and the institution which should be engagement in realization of the strategies. Without goal alignment between European governance and the entities involved in Europe 2020 - smart and sustainable development will be impossible.","Integrated maritime policy; Maritime education; Shortage of seafarers, Marine biology; Personnel; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Sustainable development; Waterway transportation; International maritime organizations; Marine biotechnology; Maritime education; Maritime training; Maritime transport; Promotional activities; Shortage of seafarers; Sustainable growth; Education",English,Conference paper,437,11,Rural Resource Management

The framework consists of three evaluation tools and a set of evaluation criteria and indicators that are linked to the tools. The appraisal of the sustainability of project alternatives is carried out by multi-criteria analysis using 16 criteria grouped under the three pillars of sustainability that were selected by an in-depth analysis of current practice in North-West Europe. The performance of these criteria is measured through a set of core and optional indicators. Stakeholders are involved in the appraisal through the multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA), which allows the consideration of conflicting stakeholder objectives and helps to identify synergies and disagreement between different stakeholder groups. The methodology is based on assessing the evaluation criteria of the different stakeholder groups. Target monitoring is carried out by setting SMART (specific, measureable, ambitious and accepted, realistic and time-bound) targets which are forecast in an ex-ante appraisal or monitored during implementation. We demonstrate the framework through the evaluation of a combined tourist travel card (MeineCardPlus) in the Nordhessen region of Germany, which provides free use of public transport and free entry to leisure facilities in and around Kassel. By considering the results of the evaluation tools side-by-side, it is possible to choose an alternative that is supported by the majority of stakeholders, performs well in the sustainability assessment and realistic in terms of policy targets. © 2016 The Authors.",", evaluation; monitoring; multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA); multi-criteria analysis (MCA); sustainable mobility",English,Conference paper,236,11,Rural Resource Management

The possibilities of mobile data are tremendous, i.e.: crowd images, frequencies of visits, foreign visitors, origin maps, traffic flows and OD-matrices can be generated locally, regionally and nationally and 24/7. The application fields are much broader than just traffic and transport: retail, city marketing, events and festivals, tourism, economy and security (crowd control) are other disciplines in which these mobility related data can generate new insights. Mobile phone data are helpful and cost effective in monitoring, evaluation, planning and policy-making [1]. In this paper we present an approach where mobile phone data is used for enriching the transport model of the region of Rotterdam. We obtained data from one of the 3 mobile phone providers in the Netherlands at which between 30% and 40% of the Dutch mobile phone usage is facilitated. This means, by accessing these data we have travel information of about one third of the total Dutch population. No other data source is known that gives travel information at a national scale at this high level. The raw data is processed into basic information which is subsequently translated into OD-information (Origin-Destination), where a destination is defined when a mobile device is longer than 30 minutes at a certain location. © 2015 BME.","Cellular telephones; Concentration (process); Cost effectiveness; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Population statistics; Telephone sets; Traffic control; Transportation; Application fields; Mobile phone datum; Mobile phone usages; Origin destination; Rotterdam; Transport modeling; Travel information; Trip distribution; Cellular telephone systems, mobile phone data; Rotterdam; transport model; trip distribution",English,Conference paper,222,4,Mobility and Transportation

This article uses a stated-choice experiment to determine residents' attitudes toward these various aspects of smart growth in the Salt Lake region of Utah. Utah is a conservative state, where attitudes toward auto-oriented suburbia may be more positive than in other parts of the United States. So, one might wonder whether changing national attitudes toward smart growth, documented in several surveys, apply to residents of the Salt Lake region. In this stated-choice experiment, respondents were asked to choose between pairs of housing scenarios with different attributes and different prices. Mixed logit (random parameters logit) was used to relate individuals' choices to attributes, prices, and sociodemographic characteristics of respondents. The results show that, generally, respondents have positive attitudes toward most aspects of smart growth but still express preferences for single-family neighborhoods with free parking in their own driveways or garages. Different life cycle cohorts have different preferences. Proximity to work is more important for childless young adults. Young families with children place higher value on living in a neighborhood with only single-family homes and transit access. Retired empty nesters favor a mix of housing types over single-family housing on one-acre-plus lots. The results suggest that while residents of the Salt Lake region like suburban neighborhoods with primarily single-family houses, they would also like to have improved accessibility to amenities in the suburbs. © 2015, © 2014 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.",", choice experiment; mixed logit model; residential choice; smart growth; stated preferences",English,Article,264,3,Urban Sustainability

The annual yield, close to 300,000. t, is mainly devoted to the international markets (more than 90%). Due to the high water demand of strawberries and to the environmental concerns of the destination countries, the maximization of water use efficiency is critical for the strawberry sector.Aiming at the efficient water use in the strawberry production, a comprehensive drip irrigation system has been designed, according to precision irrigation principles. The system has been developed based on a three stages methodology. First, the irrigation process carried out by farmers has been assessed to identify inefficiencies in the irrigation system and management. Their performances have been evaluated using indicators such as the Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS), Strawberry Irrigation Water Applied (SWA) and Strawberry Water Footprint Applied (SWFA). The second phase is focused in an accurate irrigation scheduling based in precise crop water requirements estimation and the optimum irrigation pulse design. Finally, the irrigation system has been designed with the prevailing wisdom of meets the needs of the crop in a timely manner and as efficiently and as spatially uniformly as possible. The most appropriate drip irrigation emitters for the particular conditions of the strawberry production in the study area have been selected. The rest of the on-farm irrigation technologies required to control the system have been integrated, including soil water sensors, smart water meters, programmers, electrovalves and weather station.

Bonifica 2.0 consist of a sustainable mobility network composed by full-electric vehicles and mini smart grids and involves a rehabilitation of the entire land reclamation channels system of the local area Agro Pontino. Agro Pontino is a large natural landscape (former marshland) in the Lazio region, south of Rome, where 350.000 inhabitants are settled. The area stretches over 700 km2, with drainage channels and waterways extended for about 300 km. The territory is characterized by a rich and diverse environment (it was object of land reclamation between 1926 and 1937) and holds a great potential for tourism. The project Bonifica 2.0 aims at exploring the potential for tourist exploitation for a wide area in the ""Agro Pontino"". To this end, various goals have been set, such as the creation of mixed routes that try to connect water channels with bicycle- and pedestrians paths. The concept is based on the philosophy of a sustainable mobility of waterways and coastal lakes that characterize the land. Another important goal is the restoration and revaluation of the archeological historical and cultural aspects of the area in a different and innovative way, based on the use of new environmentally sustainable means of transportation.

Each transit service has a specific set of downstream egress stations and is operated at given frequency using homogeneous vehicles of limited available capacity. We propose a static model that yields 'passenger stocks' on the platform and individual waiting times by egress station, as well as the assignment of vehicle capacity to the flows by egress station. Two cases are considered; unsaturated versus saturated. The unsaturated case is addressed by standard line combination, where service frequency is added up among the routes that serve a given egress station. The saturated case is addressed by making explicit the average number of passengers waiting on platform for a given egress station. From these passenger stocks, we deduce the individual probability to board a vehicle of limited capacity that serves a given route (hence a given subset of egress stations). Waiting passengers are assumed to be mingling on the origin platform. The subset of routes that serve a given egress station, their vehicle capacities along with the associated boarding probabilities give a line capacity by destination. The bottleneck model confronts this capacity to demand during the assignment period and provides both the stock of waiting passengers and an average waiting time per passenger. The vector of passenger stocks by egress station is shown to satisfy a fixed point problem. The existence of a solution is demonstrated. © 2015 BME.","Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Vehicles; Average waiting-time; Bottleneck models; capacitated assignment; Existence of a solutions; Fixed-point problem; Mingled waiting; Traffic assignment; Transit assignment; Transportation, bottleneck model; capacitated assignment; Mingled waiting; transit assignment",English,Conference paper,249,4,Mobility and Transportation
56543804200; 36846511000,Combining attitude theory and segmentation analysis to understand travel mode choice at a national park,2015,"Transportation management is one of the most salient challenges facing managers of national parks and public lands. In order to determine strategies to increase voluntary use of alternative transportation modes, this study explores the factors that influence travel mode choice in recreation settings. We combine the theory of planned behavior and segmentation analysis to determine distinct segments of national park visitors in regard to their beliefs about transportation. Using cluster analysis, we identify three distinct segments of visitors to a popular national park in Colorado, USA. The segments are statistically similar in regards to sociodemographic variables, yet significantly different in terms of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intentions to use shuttles. This study demonstrates the utility of combining segmentation analysis and attitude theory to inform messaging for travel information sources, such as intelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies. Combining attitude theory and segmentation analysis allows researchers and managers to identify specific types of visitor groups for targeted marketing campaigns in the context of nature tourism. Management implications This research can help managers design alternative transportation systems to alleviate congestion caused by private automobiles. Our research found that: Alternative transportation must be frequent, dependable, and provide ample space to attract loyal users.Direct routes between parking and popular attractions as well as special opportunities such as pick-up/drop-off for one-way treks may increase alternative transportation use.Promotional materials and messaging should focus on the ability of alternatives to enhance sightseeing opportunities, reduce stress caused by driving, and simplify parking.When incentives fail to increase voluntary alternative transportation use, mandatory systems may be necessary at the most popular visitor attractions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These are developing or newly industrialised countries with large, rapidly growing economies and/or a signifi cant infl uence on regional or global international affairs. We examine the scenarios for climate change in these regions and use the WaterWorld Policy Support System (v. 2.90, which is a sophisticated hydrological model, see Mulligan, 2012) to examine the likely impacts of an IPCC SRES climate scenario A2a on agricultural water use in major agricultural areas of these countries, for an ensemble of 17 General Circulation Models (GCMs). We discuss the context for agriculture in these countries and the likely trajectories for agricultural development. We then examine the BRICS export markets by volume and destination and highlight the virtual water trades associated with agriculture. We discuss the key characteristics of climate change scenarios for these regions. The BRICS show very different patterns and directions of agricultural water resource impact as a result of climate change but there is also huge uncertainty in the climate futures projected for these regions and this will make climate-smart agriculture very diffi cult to manage. These changes will have effects nationally but also along the very complex global supply chains associated with these BRICS economies. Finally, we examine other threats to agriculture in the BRICS and place these within the context of climate change and conclude that climate uncertainty is a key challenge for agricultural water resources management under climate change in the BRICS. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,English,Book chapter,260,11,Rural Resource Management

The Health and Safety Laboratory is at the forefront of these developments in the UK. This paper presents an overview of the fundamental geographical information systems concepts and methodologies that underpin the developments, and presents three case studies, drawing on applications for different regulators, to show how geographical information systems’ applications and analyses developed by the Health and Safety Laboratory produce evidence that can be used to inform regulatory activities to meet a range of challenges. Fundamental to the Health and Safety Laboratory’s approach to developing geographical information systems’ applications and solutions is the identification of appropriate information, the linking and joining of disparate datasets, and the analysis and exploitation of the subsequent intelligence. The Health and Safety Laboratory has developed datamatching algorithms and methodologies to create a number of datasets and solutions to address a range of challenges, including the development of the National Population Database – a geographical information systems-based tool to estimate population density and distribution for a wide range of population types. The National Population Database includes residential, workplace, retail, leisure, tourism and transport population estimates, as well as populations that may be more susceptible to harm, such as those in schools, hospitals, care homes and nurseries. The National Population Database is available UK-wide and at a range of resolutions, including down to building level detail, and is used across government for a wide range of applications. Using the National Population Database, along with other in-house tools and techniques, the Health and Safety Laboratory provides support and solutions to an increasingly wide range of regulatory areas through the development of: • demographic models and tools to inform the siting of new nuclear power stations on behalf of the Office of Nuclear Regulation • tools to identify the types and numbers of people exposed to risks from major hazards sites to inform regulatory activity by the Health and Safety Executive on societal risk • tools to aid the targeting of risk-based regulatory inspection to improve local authority regulation.

Cities are currently moving towards sustainable transportation, which includes non-motorised transportation (NMT). The city of Johannesburg has a goal of becoming a smart city, with sustainable development and smart mobility. Encouraging the use of non-motorised transportation and public transport has the potential of reducing the use of private motorised transport and therefor its negative consequences within the city of Johannesburg. There is limited research on cycling and how cyclists interact with cycling infrastructure within the city. The lack of such knowledge hinders proper planning for NMT. This research studies the ability of geolocation based services to provide such information which can be useful in planning for NMT. Strava Metro application is the example of such geolocation based services. The potential of this app to influence planning is investigated. According to the information acquired by Strava Metro, there are more cyclists in suburbs at the centre of Johannesburg and towards the north and to the east, and in Kibler Park at the south western part of the city. There are indications that the numbers of cycling activities recorded by Strava Metro are affected by the availability of gated communities, income levels, crime levels and the provision of infrastructure.","Crowd-sourced data; Cycling; Destinations; Non-motorised transport; Origin; Strava, Remote sensing; Tracking (position); Transportation; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Crowd-sourced data; Cycling; Destinations; Non-motorised transports; Origin; Strava; Nonmotorized transportation",English,Conference paper,212,4,Mobility and Transportation

15069902900,Smart growth and community investment: Confronting suburban decline in Baltimore,2015,"Scholars and practitioners have increasingly paid attention to the changing nature of American suburbs, with an emphasis on the decline of the nation’s older suburbs located near central cities. Commonly know as “first-tier” or “inner-ring” suburbs, these communities were once the icons of the American Dream.1 After World War II, they allowed returning veterans to escape overcrowded central cities and to purchase a spacious home with a garage and yard. Scores of city residents became suburbanites in just one generation. From the late 1940s to the early 1970s, this period became known as the Great American Century as mass suburbanization gave way to the creation of the nation’s large middle class. Yet, this prosperity was short lived. What followed were a series of social and economic transformations that changed the character and quality of life in first-tier suburbs. The last three decades of the twentieth century brought massive deindustrialization, coupled with an aging population, an obsolete housing stock, and a more diverse population. Furthermore, unfettered growth of metropolitan areas and decentralization of people and jobs meant the suburbs were no longer places of destination by 2000. These suburbs-like so many others-had reached a crossroads by the beginning of the twenty-first century. The fate of these first-tier suburbs rested in government’s ability to confront suburban decline and reengineer communities to again be places for people to live, work, and play. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

We further present examples and use cases of how such an operational approach may be used (1) for the evaluation of walkability of an urban area; (2) as a ""conventional"" planning and decision support system, through comparing the effects of urban projects on the walkability of the area; and finally (3) as a design support system, with having the sys-tem itself attempt to devise possible designs and projects, given a user-defined objective to raise the walkability of an urban area.",", Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Quality control; Design support systems; Distinct elements; Effective distance; Multi-criteria evaluation; Street network; Urban areas; Urban projects; Urban planning",English,Conference paper,172,3,Urban Sustainability

When multiple routes can reach a given destination, real-time information could be an important reference for passengers' decision-making regarding which bus to board. This paper presents a method for predicting passengers' boarding choice behaviours on common bus lines at a bus hub with real-time information. To account for the uncertainty in the decision-making process, cloud model theory, which is based on fuzzy sets, was adopted. Data from a bus hub in Dalian city of China are also presented to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that providing real-time information could lead to a deviation from passengers' typical choices that are made without real-time information. The proposed model effectively predicts passenger's boarding choices and could be used to improve bus-dispatching models in the future. © 2015 © 2015 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.",", cloud model; common bus routes; passenger boarding choice; real-time bus information",English,Article,169,4,Mobility and Transportation

The authors give definitions of a smart city and indicate the variety of methods and tools for implementing the concept in practice. Then they focus on selected rankings of smart cities and examine a few successful examples of smart initiatives from CEE. As a result of the analyses, the authors state that the philosophy of a smart city is to identify and implement the most efficient ways of providing public services in cities. The authors also found that in spite of the fact that CEE cities are not European leaders in terms of the ongoing smart initiatives and rankings of smart cities, within their territories smart solutions are implemented increasingly and more effectively. The authors indicate that the main advantage of implementing intelligent solutions in CEE cities might be building their brands and thereby encouraging the influx of new residents, investors and tourists.

54791462000; 55350530300,Towards a waste management plan for smart cities,2014,"Today the theme of waste appears to be one of the priorities at the urban level. Every citizen produces about 1 kg of waste per-capita per day, and this value is expected to grow. To speak of sustainability for this field, it means to have a new approach to solve this emergency and make the waste a resource. The objective of this paper is to present the current situation regarding the EU and Italian legislation and the existing tools aimed at sustainable waste management. About laws, the Waste Directive (2008) is important because it introduces the concept of prevention in the production of waste as one of the primary objectives. In particular, the strategy of waste management should foresee the reduction of the quantity and the hazard level of waste in a perspective of sustainable development. This theme also appears transverse to other priority urban aspects such as tourism, energy, transport. Therefore, the developed analysis will be addressed not only to the specific topic of waste but also its possible interactions. Among the possible dedicated tools, the Environmental Action Plan (set specifically for the waste) and the plans/programs proposed by the EU can be very important. At the Italian level, there are few examples of these tools. In particular, in this paper, starting from ongoing research in the Mediterranean area, will propose an “Urban Waste Management Plan”, as a reference tool for the waste management, where the management term considers different phases (collection, transportation, disposal and recovery/valorization). This plan should take into account the environmental, economic and social aspects and the characteristics of each city. Moreover, when fully operational, it will have to integrate with the other urban and regional planning tools towards a sustainable and participatory governance for cities that are really smart. © 2014 WIT Press.","Governance; Legislation and tools waste management; Sustainability; Urban waste management plan, Italy; Mediterranean Region; action plan; European Union; governance approach; legislation; sustainability; sustainable development; urban planning; waste management",English,Article,298,11,Rural Resource Management

In order to express the urban traffic, we took an advantage of the mobile phone data to investigate the behavior of the origin destination flow within the Paris and its suburb aiming to explore the different mode of the transportation. Indeed the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of mobile phone data make the task of mode of transportation separation very challenging, sometimes even impossible. Thus, by exploring the OD matrix in order to revealing any probable continues trends or any dominant trace of the flow stating a specific mode of transportation, the commuter trains happened to be somehow detectable. Then an individual-based step-by-step approach is proposed to estimate mode of transportation from mobile phone data. Analyzing the individual trajectory, the decision is given to a segment level with respect to different measures. An early promising outcome consists of detection of the segments in which people would take the metro. © 2015 The Authors.",", mobile phone data; origin-destination matrix; smart data processing; transportation mode",English,Conference paper,173,4,Mobility and Transportation

In particular, it addresses the need to identify strategic actions that will enhance the dissemination of cultural resources to facilitate cultural planning. Balancing the dynamic tension that characterizes the relationship between tourism development and protection of the landscape is key to finalizing appropriate planning strategies and actions, especially in the context of marginal rural areas. In support of theoretical and methodological reflections pertinent to this relationship, this paper presents a case study of the region of Marmilla on Italy's island of Sardinia. The absence of both a ""cultural planning"" philosophy and a strategic approach to systemic and sustainable rural tourism in this country has been acknowledged.

However, when bus operators adopt flat fare systems, users only touch-in or touch-out so that information such as origin and destination of travelers become difficult to estimate. This study is developing a methodology to estimate the passengers alighting points using smart card data given that smart cards are only used for touch-in at boarding. Our analysis is based on utilizing Bayesian Networks. The Bayesian Network model is constructed from smart card data of Shizuoka City in Japan. We observe that our methodology improves the estimation accuracy significantly compared with a base case that assumes that all passengers make round trips where they alight at the point at which they board again later in the day.","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Smart cards; Transportation; Urban transportation; Bayesian network models; Behavioral characteristics; Bus operators; Bus stop; Origin and destinations; Round trip; Transport operators; Uniform rate system; Bayesian networks, Bayesian Network; Machine learning; Smart card data; Uniform rate system",English,Conference paper,130,4,Mobility and Transportation

The book introduces an innovative evaluation approach, namely Territorial Integrated Evaluation (TIE), a meta–evaluation methodology for designing regional development scenarios. A research team from the Politecnico di Torino applied this methodology experimentally to the practices of spatial planning in Trentino in order to aid the Province in a process of institutional innovation that is still going on today. TIE defines territorial scenarios serving the need for regional economic development as well as the conservation of nature and landscape. A cross-border region, Trentino has a special need to harmonize economic development with the exceptional and internationally renowned value of its landscape which includes the Dolomites, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Therefore TIE set out to design regional development scenarios that integrated various topics – retail, tourism, infrastructures, nature and landscape. By testing out TIE in practice in this extraordinarily dynamic institutional context, the book makes a significant contribution to the discussion about newly emerging approaches to spatial planning that involve multidisciplinary vision, new paradigms in regional development, and institutional learning and capability in decision–making. © Grazia Brunetta 2015.

NoID,Development of a data-driven platform for transit performance measures using smart card and GPS data,2014,"To improve customer satisfaction and reduce operation costs, transit authorities have been striving to monitor transit service quality and identify the key factors to enhance it. The recent advent of passive data collection technologies, e.g., automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL), has shifted a data-poor environment to a data-rich environment and offered opportunities for transit agencies to conduct comprehensive transit system performance measures. However, most AFC and AVL systems are not designed for transit performance measures, implying that additional data processing and visualization procedures are needed to improve both data usability and accessibility. This study attempts to develop a data-driven platform for online transit performance monitoring. The primary data sources come from the AFC and AVL systems in Beijing, where a passenger's boarding stop (origin) and alighting stop (destination) on a flat-rate bus are not recorded. The individual transit rider's origin and destination can be estimated by utilizing a series of data-mining techniques, which are then incorporated into a regional-map platform for transit performance measures. A multilevel framework is proposed to calculate the network-level speed, route-level travel time reliability, stop-level ridership, and headway variance. These statistics are interactively displayed on a map through a simplified transit GIS data model. This platform not only serves as a data-rich visualization platform to monitor transit network performance for planning and operations, it also intends to take advantage of e-science initiative for data-driven transportation research and applications. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Automated fare collection system; Automated vehicle location system; Data-driven platform; Transit gis data model; Transit performance measures, Beijing [China]; China; Automation; Customer satisfaction; Data handling; Data visualization; Smart cards; Travel time; Vehicle locating systems; Vehicle performance; Visualization; Automated fare collection; Automated vehicle locations; Data driven; GIS data; Performance measure; automation; data processing; GIS; GPS; Internet; visualization; Data mining",English,Article,243,4,Mobility and Transportation

It is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea. In 1494, Christopher Columbus arrived in the island of Xamaica (from which “Jamaica” is derived). Initially occupied by the Arawaks and subsequently, in the early 1500s, by the Spaniards, the English gained control over the island in the mid-1700s. They remained in control until Jamaica's independence from England on August 6, 1962. African slaves were brought in and their descendants remain the nation's dominant ethnic group. Jamaica now has a population of 2.9 million people with more than 90% being Black, more than 6% mixed, and more than 2% of other ethnic groups or unknown (Central Intelligence Agency, 2013; July estimate). The official language is English, but the majority of the locals speak a dialect known as: Jamaican patois (which is a mix of English and African phonetic sounds). The island has a literacy rate of 87%, an unemployment rate of over 14%, a poverty rate of 16.5%, an inflation rate of 6.9% and a life expectancy of 73 years (Central Intelligence Agency, 2013). Christianity is the dominant religion. The Jamaican economy is heavily reliant on service industries, which represented over 60% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 (Central Intelligence Agency, 2013). The island's foreign exchange, which gives an indication of a nation's economic health and the overall welfare of its people, comes largely from bauxite, tourism, and remittances (ibid.). Proudly, however, many Jamaicans refer to their country as “likkle but tallawah” (meaning small but mighty) in reference to Jamaicans’ ability to not only compete with persons from more developed countries, but to outperform on the world stage as evidenced by the exportation of its culture, the popularity of reggae music, and athletic talents like legendary sprinter Usain Bolt. © Anita Kalunta-Crumpton 2015.

The research results found that the festival is based on the long-standing custom of offering candles as a method of worship. There were found to be six reasons for the strength of the candle festival in Ubon Ratchatani, which were: a) Ubon Ratchatani is a Buddhist city that has more temples than any other city in Thailand; b) the local people are particularly philanthropic and intelligent; c) the city itself was built on the area of dong-oo-peung, which has a number of important resources used in the tien pansa celebration; d) the Ubon Ratchatani people pay special attention and care to the homage of the Buddhist Triple Gems; e) Ubon Ratchatni is home to skilled artisans in all branches of the fine arts; g) the festival adheres to the founding principles of worship and respect, with the intention of promoting the Buddhist religion.

In response to rising energy costs and increased environmental concerns, eco-friendly route choices can be provided individually by means of smart navigation tools that allow several vehicle routing options designed to minimize air pollutant emissions and fuel consumption. Simultaneously, the use of intelligent road pricing systems and the use of variable message signs can change the route choice process of drivers (and thus network equilibrium), by varying the perceived attributes of competing routes. However, so far too little attention has been paid to the fact that the eco-friendliness of various routes may change, depending on vehicle characteristics which may cause problems on the efficiency of these systems. This issue has been empirically addressed in this research, using a database of more than 13,330 km of GPS data in six different Origin-Destination (OD) pairs and 9 different routes. Simultaneously, two different approaches for estimating (CO2, HC, CO, NOX) emissions were tested: a) second-by-second vehicle dynamics, using the Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) instantaneous model; and b) route average speed using the EMEP/EEA methodology. The results show that depending on the characteristics of the routes associated with a certain OD pair, the eco-friendly route may differ according to the vehicle model and the emissions estimation method.

This is a distribution supply dependent model, with single constraints on trip production for work trips during morning peak hours (6:00 a.m.–9:00 a.m.) within the Island of Montreal, Canada. Different data sets, including the 2008 Origin–Destination (OD) survey of the Greater Montreal Area, the 2006 Census of Canada, GTFS network data, along with the geographical data of the study area, are used. EIOM is a nonlinear model composed of socio-demographics, PT supply data and work location attributes. An enhanced destination ranking procedure is used to calculate the number of spatially cumulative opportunities, the basic variable of EIOM. For comparison, a Basic Intervening Opportunities Model (BIOM) is developed by using the basic destination ranking procedure. The main difference between EIOM and BIOM is in the destination ranking procedure: EIOM considers the maximization of a utility function composed of PT Level Of Service and number of opportunities at the destination, along with the OD trip duration, whereas BIOM is based on a destination ranking derived only from OD trip durations. Analysis confirmed that EIOM is more accurate than BIOM. This study presents a new tool for PT analysts, planners and policy makers to study the potential changes in PT trip patterns due to changes in socio-demographic characteristics, PT supply, and other factors.

The aim is an intelligent control and management system of parking pricing integrated with a redefinition of the circulation scheme for a limited traffic zone in the Central Business District (CBD) of Palermo. The transport demand over the entire area of the town has been studied in order to design various parking pricing scenarios with the application of an additional cost on parking inside the selected area of the CBD. This area attracts most of the private vehicular traffic and it is characterized by university faculties, schools, hospitals, offices and commercial areas. The optimal hourly toll is defined by an iterative maximization process of an objective function. This objective function is subject to the following constraint: the percentage of available parking in the various parking zones has to remain major of the 30%. In this way, the users who need to park close to their final destination can easily find parking. Otherwise it is possible to leave the private car in a ""park and ride"" area and taking a shuttle bus directed towards the zones of the CBD. A basic principle of this pricing policy is the re-use of revenues for two purposes: to design a shuttle bus service that connects the various ""park and ride"" areas to the CBD and to improve the local public transport service on the OD pairs that show high travel demand. At the same time it is necessary to eliminate the stop and go flow in cordon roads to increase the capacity and avoid congestion in these critical links. The method shows that in a very simple, and relatively fast, way is possible to get a proposal for the modification of the parking pricing scheme that makes the city center no longer stifled by private car traffic. © 2014 The Authors.",", limited traffic zone; park and ride; parking pricing; parking zones; shuttle bus",English,Conference paper,316,4,Mobility and Transportation
7102108552; 56828293300,Vehicle routing based on discrete particle swarm optimization and google maps API,2014,"Transportation imposes considerable cost on goods and has a significant influence on competitive advantage of a company. How to reduce the costs and improve the profit of a company is an important issue. Vehicle routing is a critical factor in reducing transportation costs. Finding optimal vehicle routes offers great potential to efficiently manage fleets, reduce costs and improve service quality. An effective scheme to manage fleets and determine vehicle routes for delivering goods is important for carriers to survive. In the existing literature, a variety of vehicle routing problems (VRP) have been studied. However, most papers do not integrate with GIS. In this paper, we consider a variant of VRP called Vehicle Routing Problem with Arbitrary Pickup and Delivery points (VRPAPD). The goal of this paper is to develop an algorithm for VRPAPD based on Google Maps API. To achieve this goal, we propose an operation model and formulate an optimization problem. In our problem formulation, we consider a set of goods to be picked up and delivered. Each goods has a source address and a destination address. The vehicles to transport the goods have associated capacities, including the maximal weight a vehicle can be carried and the maximal distance a vehicle can travel. The problem is to minimize the routes for picking up and delivering goods. The emerging Google Maps API provides a convenient package to develop an effective vehicle routing system. In this paper, we develop a vehicle routing algorithm by combining a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) method with Google Maps API. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by an example.","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Cost reduction; Costs; Decision support systems; Electronic commerce; Information systems; Internet; Network routing; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Routing algorithms; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Competitive advantage; Discrete particle swarm optimization; Google maps; Optimization problems; Particle swarm; Transportation cost; Vehicle routing problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Freight transportation, Decision support system; Discrete particle swarm; Google Maps API; Vehicle routing problem",English,Conference paper,265,4,Mobility and Transportation

Our approach remains unchanged. The base is still made of information on the movement of the aforementioned representative of the Volyn branch of the Rurik dynasty. We do not, however, shy away from using, according to needs, the analogy. Our main source will be again the HalychVolynian Chronicle. Daniel was a very mobile ruler. Large, though impossible to precisely define, part of his life he spend on the road. He had the opportunity to see many places and to meet, while travelling, a huge number of people. Unfortunately, and this is a sad conclusion to a researcher, we are not able to say anything about Daniel's approach to what he could see and get to know to a better or lesser extend (whatever that could mean). We do not know whether he was interested in the places through which he passed, what kind of things aroused his curiosity, and whether he made any efforts to see something in particular. There are no sources upon which one could relay to make any enunciations in this matter. At most, we can say that he was - almost certainly - a smart observer. We have tried to present any available in sources information on the subject of travel of any specific Russian medieval ruler. The image that transpires is - unfortunately - highly incomplete, even after filling it by using analogy. This is determined by the state of sources. However, it is possible to postulate that the research on Rurik dynasty mobility should be continued.

Since this process can be regarded as complex and tricky, natural resource management requires a well-structured and transparent decision-making process. In this regard, it is necessary to search for and implement sets of measures which can effectively solve emerging problems. Based on the assumption that decisions concerning the management of watersheds may imply trade-offs between their different functions, the intent was to test if software tools, such as MULINO, could be used to enhance multi-level governance of ecosystems. To achieve this, the DPSIR and MCA were incorporated, to analyze and quantify the explicit trade-offs between several types of services provided by estuarine ecosystems and stakeholder objectives. The Mondego Estuary (Portugal) was used as case study. This system is under constant pressure, from both natural and anthropogenic drivers. Urban expansion and tourism were identified as having a strong impact on system development, while agriculture, although declining, had a determinant role in the system's status. The study evaluated potential alternatives focusing on the water quality improvement goals that could be designed for the system. The MCA ranked several alternatives and pinpointed as the best option the alternative that combines buffer zones, eco-tourism enhancement, wastewater treatment plant development, the Murraceira trademark and bivalves bio-control.

In general, poor information to customers is one of the main issues in public transportation services, which is an important reason for allocating substantial efforts to implement a powerful and easy to use and access information tool. This paper focuses on the design and development of a real time mobility information system for the management of unexpected events, delays and service disruptions concerning public transportation in the city of Milan. Exploiting the information on the status of urban mobility and on the location of citizens, commuters and tourists, the system is able to reschedule in real time their movements. The service proposed stems from the state of the art in the field of travel planners for public transportation, available for Milan. Peculiarly, we built a representation of the city transit based on a time-expanded graph that considers the interconnections among all the stops of the rides offered during the day. The structure distinguishes the physical stations and the get on/get off stops of each ride, representing them with two different types of nodes. Such structure allows, with regard to the main focus of the project, to model a wide range of service disruptions, much more meaningful than those possible with approaches currently proposed by transit agencies. One of the most interesting point lies in the expressive capability in describing the different disruptions: with our model it is possible, for instance, to selectively inhibit getting on and/or off at a particular station, avoid specific rides, and model temporary deviations. © 2015 The Authors.",", advanced traveller information; public transport; time-dependent minimum path; travel planner",English,Conference paper,283,4,Mobility and Transportation
7007056605; 57189064398,Enterprise and entrepreneurship on islands,2014,"Purpose – This chapter contributes to addressing the gap in the literature on entrepreneurs and enterprise in island and remote rural environments. Approach – The research, policy and practice literature on island enterprises and entrepreneurs is reviewed, taking Scotland as a focus within wider international contexts. Islands – as spaces and cultural places – are recognised in terms of 'otherness' and difference, not least in respect of tourism and culture. The importance of distance, isolation and peripherality is discussed as social constructions – myths and narratives – as well as in their mainstream measured equivalences. Agencies and policies are introduced at different levels and given significance reflecting their particular relevance in remote and isolated communities. The significance of the dominant paradigm founded on agglomeration, clusters, connectivity, proximity and competitiveness in the peripheralisation of those establishing and running businesses on islands is explored critically. This is contrasted with experiences from comparative northern European locations of smart specialisation, innovation and resilience, and the underpinning key roles of social capital, relationships and cultural values and norms are identified. Sectoral case studies and enterprise are offered to examine these issues in context. Findings – As this is an exploratory study, results are neither comprehensive nor definitive. However, they are indicative of how forces and obstacles apply in island and remote rural environments. Research, practical and social implications – The study confirms the need to recognise social relations locally, and for policies and strategies to be proofed for locational differences. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",", Enterprise; Entrepreneurship; Islands; Place; Remote rural areas; Scotland",English,Review,252,11,Rural Resource Management

One of these strategies employed in Western European countries in past decades has been low-cost outsourcing in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly derived from low wages. Specifically, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary are prime destinations for low-cost outsourcing as well as foreign direct investment. However, there is a trend of increased wage levels in Central and Eastern European countries, urging the question of how long (time period) cost advantages can be gained there in the future. Accordingly, in a situation of diminishing cost advantages, the question can be posed to what extent traditional manufacturing will “return” to Western Europe if smart manufacturing methods are being used. This study adopts a scenario-analysis approach in which five scenarios are drawn, particularly focusing on labor cost development and the crucial cost advantage and other critical factors in outsourcing, such as the availability of low-skilled labor, productivity changes, and greening of manufacturing. In one scenario, “reshuffle,” cost reduction will be abandoned as the competitive strategy in favor of high product quality. Each scenario will be examined in terms of attractiveness for outsourcing and potential implications on decisions by companies for (continuing) outsourcing relationships with Central and Eastern Europe. © IIE, INCOSE.",", Comparative advantages; Eastern Europe; Low-cost strategies; Outsourcing; Scenarios; Smart manufacturing; Traditional technology",English,Article,211,11,Rural Resource Management

This means creating more products - values, for more customers, with superior productivity and proper management of the risks caused by growth itself. In this context, the expression ""grow or disappear"" is replaced by ""improve in order to stay competitive"". The objective of this paper is to highlight the way in which the implementation of the sustainable development principles are correlated with the aspects of organic growth in tourism and the possibility of evaluating the organic growth from the perspective of sustainable development. In order to achieve the proposed objective, it was conducted a qualitative marketing research among hotel managers in Bra?ov County. Collected using the quota method, the sample is a non-probabilistic type, and the research was conducted based on semi-structured interview, a method chosen in accordance to the type of research. The major contributions of the research process are to highlight the relation between the sustainable development and organic growth, to propose a general configuration of the marketing strategy pillars of sustainable business in tourism and to identify some methods of evaluating the organic growth from the perspective of sustainable development.",", Marketing; Marketing 3.0; Organic/smart growth; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Sustainable tourism",English,Article,222,3,Urban Sustainability

These include the strategic positioning of town centres, managing the evening and night-time economies effectively, the growing role of the experience economy to town centre attractiveness beyond mere retail-led approaches, the potential dichotomy between physical town centres and digital high streets, more human smart cities, as well as the growing role of emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and the circular economy. It is argued that place management practitioners will need to address these trends proactively (rather than reactively) and that further research is required in order to understand the complex interactions of the various parameters managed by place managers to keep town centres vibrant, viable, innovative and resilient to further global economic downturns. © Henry Stewart Publications.",", Business improvement districts; City management; Destination management; Digital high streets; Evening and night-time economy; Events; Experience economy; Smart cities; Town centre management; Towns",English,Article,148,3,Urban Sustainability
56593003700,How to manage conflicts between resources’ exploitation and identity values:The agri valley amid oil supply and the lucanian apennines national park,2015,"In the mid-1990s, the valley landscape of Basilicata found itself at a crossroads between two contrasting development models. One was based on the supply of hydrocarbons, with a view to starting up a heavily industrialised process, whilst the other drew its inspiration from local development policies, based on nature tourism and high-quality agriculture. Basilicata attempted to find a middle ground, which could respect the principles of ecological, economic and social sustainability in agreement with oil company activity. Twenty years later, the Agri Valley is a far cry from achieving the following two goals for the future, putting itself forward as a model for a sustainable economy and becoming a large-scale centre for energy production. The construction of the biggest onshore extraction plant in mainland Europe in the heart of the Lucanian Apennines National Park is producing a serious environmental impact. If we consider the current political, economic and financial climate, the now well-established cultural concepts of smart growth and the OECD Better Life Index forecast, which considers the well-being industry and the green economy to be the main driving forces for the global economy over the next 20 years, does it still make sense to obsessively consider oil as the areas main driving force for growth? The aim of this contribution is to highlight and discuss the conflicts and paradoxes which stem both from different ways of interpreting the term resource and from the ambiguous nature of identity values in an area where resources exploitation implies deeply contrasting notions of landscapes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",", Basilicata; Local development; Oil; Royalties",English,Book chapter,257,11,Rural Resource Management

However, it is under the pressure of massive tourism, low participation of local community, and improper management. It is a matter of great urgency to determine strategies and tools in support of the balance between conservation and development of national nature reserve. This paper aims to find out the way to identify, preserve, manage and revitalize nature reserves with all of its tangible and intangible qualities, by developing sustainable ecotourism as catalyst. Based on the problems mentioned above, five sustainable development strategies have been put forward which involves keeping to ecological capacity, promoting community participation method, offering natural education opportunities, developing green economic mode and introducing smart tourism techniques. Seeing the resources inside the reserve areas as a natural, cultural, social and economic asset, ecotourism planning is holistic by integrating the goals of natural resources conservation and those of social and economic improvement in revitalizing and managing national nature reserve.","Catalysts; Conservation; Ecosystems; Planning; Stream flow; Sustainable development; Community participation; Conservation and development; Eco-tourisms; Ecological capacity; Economic improvements; Nature reserves; Planning methodology; Strategies and tools; Ecology, Ecotourism; Nature reserve; Planning methodology; Sustainable development",English,Conference paper,165,11,Rural Resource Management

Furthermore, to ensure accurate travel-time prediction, our solution employs an analytic mechanism on back end to maintain up-to-date inter-connecting information among chosen POIs so that any changes during the trip can be reflected in a timely manner. Therefore, our solution can allow travelers to fast create an efficient and economic trip plan. After an itinerary planed, travelers can use the payment information in account to pay on sites across the web. Furthermore, we implement a novel mobile application for tourists interactive on traveling.

However, despite the global interest and the investments worldwide, the user acceptance level is still low, mainly due to the lack of charging services support. This is one of the main causes for the so called 'EV driver's anxiety', and has led people to consider EV mobility suitable only for short routes. To contrast this issue, we propose here a route planner application supporting EV mobility also on medium and long routes, through prediction of range and charging stops. Our application estimates the minimal energy consumption path, by also considering the overhead to reach the charging stations along the way towards the destination. We demonstrate the optimality of the algorithm and we describe its implementation within a Web-application which connects to charging providers' services (to retrieve the locations of charging spots) and to Google services (for routing directions and real-time traffic data). Finally, we evaluate the scalability of our application, and we study its effectiveness in supporting EV routes on large-scale scenarios (e.g. the Emila-Romagna region in Italy) through immersive simulation techniques. © 2014 IEEE.",", Carbon; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Investments; Carbon emissions; Charging station; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Minimal energy; Real-time traffic datum; Simulation technique; User acceptance; WEB application; Vehicles",English,Conference paper,196,4,Mobility and Transportation

They range from the participation in travel diary surveys to the technical records of mobile phone providers: some of them are recent, such as tracing by smart phones, some are driven by the curiosity of the travellers themselves, such as the dollar bill tracing website www.wheresgeorg.com, some by national accounting or policy making, such as the various national travel diary studies. Each of the available forms has well-known biases during the various phases of data collection and processing, which we try to highlight and discuss. It is necessary to point out, that the object of the data collection varies between the approaches. Traditional transport planning, national statistics driven approaches are interested in identifiable movements, for example stages, trips or journeys, which can be described with an origin, a destination, a purpose and a (main-)mode and associated with the person undertaking this movement. This movement has social meaning as it has been undertaken to satisfy some need or task of the person reporting it.

This paper confines its focus mainly to India’s relations with Malaysia as the Southeast Asian country with the largest Indian diaspora. The paper argues that India’s growing diplomatic, institutional, political and security engagement with ASEAN-led institutions such as ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit is at least partially inspired by the prospect of leveraging on the presence of the Indian diaspora in Southeast Asia. It concludes that while occasional frictions may arise in India-Malaysia relations over the treatment of ethnic Indians in the country, the benefits of India’s more robust engagement with Malaysia/ASEAN outweigh the costs, given the expanding economic, industrial, commercial, investment, trade and tourism opportunities - all of which can produce a direct if not indirect impact on India’s strategic perceptions of the role of the diaspora in facilitating a more proactive engagement with the region. The quality and quantity of such interactions, buttressed by the use of ‘smart power’, will invariably influence the future direction of India’s foreign and security policy towards Malaysia/Southeast Asia. © 2015 Organisation for Diaspora Initiatives, New Delhi.",", Foreign and security policy; India-malaysia interactions; Indian diaspora; Southeast asia; Strategic asset",English,Article,208,11,Rural Resource Management

To track where commuters travel from and to (but not commute times), we use transactional smartcard data from residents in Singapore to construct the (daily) spatial network of trips generated. We use the Place Rank method to demonstrate the viability of the flow-based approach to study accessibility. We compute the Place Rank of each of 44 planning areas in Singapore. Interestingly, even though the spatial network is constructed using only origin-destination information, we find that the travel time of the trips out of each planning area generally decreases as the area's Place Rank increases. The same is also the case for in-vehicle time, number of transfers in the network and transfer time. This shows that a flow-based approach can be used to measure the notion of accessibility, which is traditionally assessed using travel time information in the system. We also compare Place Rank with other indicators, namely, bus stop density, eigenvector centrality, clustering coefficient and typographical coefficient to evaluate an area's accessibility. The results show that these indicators are not as effective as the Place Rank method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Accessibility; Place Rank; Public transport; Smartcard data, Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Smart cards; Traffic control; Travel time; Accessibility; Clustering coefficient; Eigenvector centralities; Origin destination; Place Rank; Public transport; Smartcard datum; Travel time information; accessibility; flow modeling; network analysis; public transport; spatial analysis; transportation planning; travel behavior; travel time; Information use",English,Article,200,4,Mobility and Transportation

This paper addresses the application of Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) data to analyze transit commuters travel demand. This study involved collection of APTS data and boarding stops information by combining smart card data and intelligent dispatching data. Transit commuters were judged according to travel frequency of morning and evening traffic peaks. The residences and work places were identified by spatial-temporal characteristics of commuters travel. Based on this idea, an estimation algorithm was proposed. The algorithm was tested and analyzed using large-scale APTS data. Finally, the method's accuracy was analyzed by comparison with the ""Trip-chain"" method. The proposed method provides some advantages including, high accuracy and strong operability. The study provides a fast and economic new approach to acquiring transit commuters Origin-Destination (OD) distribution. © 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.","Advanced public transportation systems; Algorithms; Highway engineering; Motor transportation; Smart cards; commuters travel; Estimation algorithm; New approaches; Origin destination; Public transportation; Spatial-temporal characteristics; Traffic Engineering; Urban traffic congestion; Commuters travel; Traffic control, advanced public transportation systems (APTS); commuters travel; OD (origin-destination); public transportation; smart card; traffic engineering",English,Article,150,4,Mobility and Transportation

6603708352,Creating OD matrix using cordon survey: Case study - city of Varaždin,2013,"Nowadays, cities have a problem with transport planning. Transport planning is a time-consuming process and a data-eating process. For the purpose of transport planning, it is necessary to collect up-to-date data, not only transport data (number of vehicles, bus lines, passengers carried, etc.), but also demographic data, urbanization data and economic data. The most frequently changed data are those from transport, which means it is necessary to implement a strategic process to collect these data. This process is not only time-consuming but also money-consuming. Without transport data it is not possible to make smart mobility plans for citizens. The most important function of transport data collection is building of an Origin-Destination Matrix (OD Matrix). There is a wide range of methods for collecting and building of this OD Matrix. This paper explains the building of OD Matrix using innovated cordon survey in road transport. Cordon survey is a field method to collect information about travel preferences of road drivers. Cordon survey has been performed on strategic points entering the City of Varaždin. The cordon survey was carried out during two-hour intervals in early morning, late morning and afternoon. © 2013 WIT Press.","Cordon survey; OD matrix; Transport planning, Croatia; Varazdin; Urban transportation; Demographic data; Number of vehicles; O-D matrix; Origin-destination matrix; Road transports; Strategic process; Transport data; Transport planning; carbon budget; data acquisition; information management; matrix; strategic approach; surveying; transportation planning; Surveys",English,Conference paper,192,4,Mobility and Transportation

We will not move toward a more sustainable society unless we accept that children are people with transportation needs, and 'bussing' them around, or providing parental limousine services at all times, will not lead to sustainability. Rather, we will need to make our cities walkable for children, at least those above a certain age. Safety has two main aspects, traffic safety and personal safety (risk of assault). Besides being safe, children will also need an urban environment with reasonable mobility, where they themselves can reach destinations with reasonable effort; else they will still need to be driven. This paper presents the results of two expert questionnaires focusing on the potential safety and mobility benefits to child pedestrians of targeted types of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Five different types of functional requests for children were identified based on previous work. The first expert questionnaire was structured to collect expert opinions on which ITS solutions or devices would be, and why, the most relevant ones to satisfy the five different functional requests of child pedestrians. Based on the first questionnaire, fifteen problem areas were defined. In the second questionnaire, the experts ranked the fifteen areas, and prioritized related ITS services, according to their potential for developing ITS services beneficial to children. Several ITS systems for improving pedestrian quality are discussed. ITS services can be used when a pedestrian route takes them to a dangerous street, dangerous crossing point or through a dangerous neighborhood. An improvement of safety and other qualities would lead to increased mobility and a more sustainable way of living. Children would learn how to live to support their own health and a sustainable city environment. But it will be up to national, regional and local governments, through their ministries and agencies and public works departments, to promote, fund, and possibly mandate such systems. It is clear that we need to offer an acceptable level of convenience, efficiency, comfort, safety and security to pedestrians but it is less clear if society will prioritize resources toward this. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

With two decades after the advent of democracy in South Africa, the land question remains a critical issue for policy makers. A number of frameworks have been put in place by the government to identify land which is strategically located for land reform. However, many of these frameworks are not well aligned and have hampered the government's land reform initiative in promoting inclusive development. Strategically located land is herein defined as land parcels that are well positioned for the promotion of agriculture, human settlements, rural and tourism development. Accordingly, there is a need to develop a decision tool which facilitates the identification of strategically located land for development. This study proposes the use of geographic information systems (GIS), earth observation (EO) data and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) to develop a spatial decision support system (SDSS) to identify strategically located land for land reform. The SDDS was therefore designed using GIS, EO data and MCDM to create an index for identification of strategically located land. Expert-led workshops were carried out to ascertain criteria for identifying strategically located land and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was utilised used to weight the criteria. The study demonstrates that GIS and EO are invaluable tools in facilitating evidence-based decisions for land reform. However, there is need for capacity building on GIS and EO in government departments responsible for land reform and development planning. The study suggests that there is an urgent need to develop sector specific criteria for the identification of strategically located land for inclusive development.","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information use; Earth observation data; Guideline for author; ISPRS annals; ISPRS archive; Manuscript; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Proceeding; South Africa; Styleguide; Geographic information systems, Guidelines for authors; ISPRS annals; ISPRS archives; Manuscripts; Proceedings; Styleguide",English,Conference paper,266,3,Urban Sustainability

This research aims to identify conservation and compatible areas for tourism development in Johor Ramsar sites, using spatial modeling in geographic information system (GIS). The study describes a methodological approach based on the integrated use of GIS and multi criteria decision evaluation (MCE) to identify nature conservation and development priorities among the wetland areas. A set of criteria was defined to evaluate wetland biodiversity conservation and development. Having defined the criteria, the next step was selecting suitable indicators and variables to measure the selected criteria. Subsequently the criteria were evaluated from conservation and tourism development point of view. These criteria were then weighted using the pair wise comparison technique of MCE and the results were integrated into GIS. Several conservation scenarios were generated so as to simulate different evaluation perspectives. The scenarios were then compared to highlight the most feasible and to propose a conservation and development strategy for the wetland areas. The generation and comparison of conservation and development scenarios highlighted the critical issues of the decision problem.

7403361985; 16241176500,Developing destinations in the northern periphery,2013,"Introduction Tourism is often identified as an important tool for sustaining rural communities, not least in peripheral areas (Butler et al. 1998; Müller and Jansson 2007). This is partly a government response to rural restructuring and a decline in traditional rural industries. However, increasing global competition in relation to people, capital and investments is forcing rural communities to find new ways to reimage their place and remain competitive (Hall 2005). For people in these communities, tourism appears to be one of the few options for making a living in an increasingly de-industrialized rural arena (Müller 2011). However, developing tourism is not an easy endeavor, particularly in peripheries that are remote from populated demand markets (Müller and Jansson 2007). For tourism businesses, limited accessibility constrains the number of potential tourists and thus companies have to earn rather high revenues per visiting tourist. This implies high quality requirements to justify the necessary price levels. For public sector stakeholders, there are also other problems that challenge the successful development of tourism. A lack of access to economic capital, political influence and competent human resources within tourism are only some of the issues that local communities face (Botterill et al. 2000; Hall and Boyd 2005). Moreover, finding a common re-imaging strategy acceptable to all tourism stakeholders is sometimes difficult. While public stakeholders usually have ambitions to engage in long-term planning, tourism entrepreneurs tend to be reliant on shorter planning horizons, forcing them to utilize all business opportunities they receive (Russell and Faulkner 1999). Particularly the lack of knowledge about tourism within the public sector, but also within the private sector, where lifestyle businesses sometimes dominate, can turn out to be a major shortcoming when engaging with destination development. Market intelligence is needed here, including linkages with the wholesaler and incoming companies. Moreover, companies’ marketing budgets usually have to be pooled to facilitate visibility in the marketplace. A major question is how to enable this development and maintain it by learning from other destinations. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an analysis of learning and the development of a rural tourist destination. This is mainly done through a case study of the organization that markets the Gold of Lapland destination in Northern Sweden and the ability of another destination, the Kvarken Archipelago World Heritage Site outside Vaasa, Finland, to learn from the Swedish experiences. Certainly, the cases at hand differ regarding their historical and current contexts. The Gold of Lapland area is a traditional mining and industrial area suffering from de-industrialization and de-population, and has been turned into a tourist destination in order to deal with these problems. In contrast, the Kvarken Archipelago is located close to the center of Vaasa, and though rural in character and tradition it has benefitted greatly from its location. Thus, tourism is not the first option for maintaining a livelihood in the region. Instead, the World Heritage Area is simply seen as a protected area that can be consumed by urban dwellers and possibly tourists from Vaasa and elsewhere. However, it is not only the historical-geographical setting that distinguishes the areas from each other, as different national strategies regarding tourism also play a role. In Sweden, public policy on tourism is implemented by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Tillväxtverket), and it clearly focuses on entrepreneurship and business development. This focus on growth also increasingly compromises other realms of public policy. Thus, today even the protection of culture and nature is seen in the light of economic growth and development. In the Finnish case agencies responsible for the environment seem to play a greater role, though even here tourism is increasingly seen as part of regional innovation and growth strategies. Still, tourism appears to be primarily located in the realm of planning rather than business development. Thus, business-related models as expressed in the destination approach are rather absent in the Finnish case while they dominate the Swedish way of thinking about the development of tourism. Despite these differences, there is reason to study the processes of adaptation needed in order to change and the learning dimensions involved. © 2013 selection and editorial material, Åge Mariussen and Seija Virkkala; individual chapters, the contributors.",,English,Book chapter,697,3,Urban Sustainability

In fact, ecotourism can help to revive a declining tourist destination as it preserves nature and support rehabilitation and most importantly, it fits well with the Biosphere Reserve functions of conservation, development and logistics. This article aims to analyse the life cycle of Tasik Chini as an ecotourism destination, by focusing on the following aspects, namely travel engagement, ecotourism approaches and revitalization initiatives. This study utilized a mixed method approach by combining the primary and secondary data in tracing the evolution, development and the existing stage of ecotourism. The study reveals that the four major components which drive ecotourism program/initiatives toward achieving sustainable development are the state of ecotourism in the BR, the targeted segments of the community, the extent of community involvement as well as the supportive infrastructure for ecotourism. As ecotourism in the BR significantly promotes learning and research, smart partnership or collaboration between the stakeholders will help generate true eco-tourists. It is therefore imperative that ecotourism initiatives in the context of the BR is revitalised as it will enable a reflective analysis of the destination's life cycle. The intervention of credible initiatives can fulfil the real and future roles of ecotourism in sustainable development. © the author(s).",", Ecotourism; Exploration; Life cycle of a destination; Local involvement; Revitalizing",English,Article,225,11,Rural Resource Management

Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) over the years has utilized many sophisticated technologies and smart strategies. Municipalities worldwide have pursued numerous initiatives to reduce the environmental burden of the MSW treatment strategies. One of the most beneficial MSWM strategies is the thermal treatment or energy recovery to obtain cleaner renewable energy from waste. Among many waste-to-energy strategies, refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is a solid recovered fuel that can be used as a substitute for conventional fossil fuel. The scope of this study is to investigate the feasibility of RDF production with MSW generated in Metro Vancouver, for co-processing in two cement kilns in the region. This study investigates environmental impacts and benefits and economic costs and profits of RDF production. In addition, RDF utilization as an alternative fuel in cement kilns has been assessed. Cement manufacturing has been selected as one of the most environmentally challenged industries and as a potential destination for RDF to replace a portion of conventional fossil fuels with less energy-intensive fuel. A comprehensive environmental assessment is conducted using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. In addition, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has been carried out to study the economic factors. This research confirmed that RDF production and use in cement kilns can be environmentally and economically viable solution for Metro Vancouver.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In some European rural areas it is seen as a smart diversification solution. Even though agritourism is rather weak on the Walloon tourist market level, it is important for farmers for whom it is often a means of supplementary income. Based on crossed data concerning potential tourists, local tenants, privileged witnesses and promotional information, the position of agritourism on the Walloon tourist market is analysed. It is shown that agritourism is a multiple micro-niche market primarily complementary to other sources of tourist supply.

56451461700; 56451478000; 52264268900,Climate smart development in Asia: An overview,2013,"Global climate change is perhaps one of the most serious challenges facing humanity. It is no longer just an environmental issue but one with enormous socio-economic and geopolitical implications. The 4th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that climate change is unequivocal and that human influence on the global climate system through anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the past 150 years is substantial (IPCC 2007). For example, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO from pre-industrial levels of 280 parts per million (ppm) to 390 ppm in 2010. If the effect of other GHGs is included, the concentration is at the equivalent of 430 ppm. The IPCC concluded that the average global temperature increased by 0.74 °C between 1905 and 2005 due to human-induced climate change, and that temperatures would rise by another 1.1 to 6.4 °C by the end of this century. In order to stabilize the climate, the IPCC concluded that GHG emissions must peak before 2020 and be reduced by 40 to 70 percent by 2050 (IPCC 2007). However, when we consider that both world energy use and associated GHG emissions are expected to grow nearly 50 percent by 2030, an average rate of 1.7 percent per year, the enormity of the challenge becomes obvious. Indeed, the current emissions trajectory may result in an atmospheric GHG concentration of 650 ppm or more by the end of this century (Flavin 2008). As many countries in Asia have entered the most carbon-and energy-intensive stages of their development and some are now experiencing high rates of deforestation and forest degradation, Asia’s share in global GHG emissions is expected to increase substantially. If no major changes are made, Asia may contribute as much as 45 percent of global energy-related GHG emissions by 2030 (IEA 2011). The continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels to meet Asia’s growing energy needs, espe- cially in its industrial and transport sectors, will further worsen air pollution and dramatically increase social costs. Unchecked growth in GHG emissions will increase the likelihood of abrupt climatic change, leading to devastating effects on ecosystems, industries, agriculture, and transportation systems (Solomon et al. 2009). The impacts of climate change are already evident in many parts of Asia in the form of increased frequency and intensity of extreme climate events, including floods and droughts (IPCC 2007). Due to historical build-up of GHG in the atmosphere, such adverse impacts will continue to be felt in the foreseeable future, even if GHG mitigation efforts pick up momentum. Therefore, adaptation to enhance the climate resilience of economic, social, and environmental systems is crucial. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change estimated that the cost of inaction on climate change could be as high as 5 to 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) while the cost of action could be less than 1 percent of global GDP (Stern 2007). The transition from a “carbon-intensive climate-sensitive” development para- digm to a “low carbon climate resilient” economy (LCE) is an enormous challenge that will require significant restructuring of economies in both developed and developing countries. Indeed, the efforts to restrain GHG emissions to date have mostly been a combination of technology and policy solutions by developed countries, which are not necessarily always appropriate in developing countries in Asia. Evidence to date suggests that such interventions have had positive but limited impacts on GHG concentrations. Therefore, more proactive approaches to the design and implementation of climate smart road maps are needed. Likewise, the reactive and unplanned measures to cope with adverse impacts of climate change have consumed enormous financial resources without much improvement in climate resilience. Developing countries in Asia, therefore, have to take a more proactive role in addressing this issue in a way that is most appropriate to their national circumstances and capabilities. Stabilizing the climate will require considerable effort, namely, a broad trans- formation of the various sectors of the economy - energy, transport, agriculture, forestry and others - so that economic output can be raised without substantial increases in GHG emissions. Decarbonizing energy systems will require both a decrease in energy demand and promotion of technologies that reduce fossil fuel consumption. Likewise, promoting climate-friendly urban development strategies and environmentally sustainable transport systems is vital. Further efforts to enhance carbon sequestration through sustainable land use and forest management, including reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), are crucial. Many countries realize the need to halve global GHG emissions by 2050 by intensifying efforts to follow climate smart pathways for development. The 15th Conference of Parties (COP-15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in December 2009, produced a clear letter of political intent in the form of the “Copenhagen Accord” to constrain carbon and respond to climate change. The accord included a goal of limiting global mean temperature rise to below 2°C above pre-industrial times. More than 140 countries indicated their support to the accord so far. Of them, 42 developed countries and 41 developing countries, which together account for more than 80 percent of global GHG emissions, pledged nationally appropriate mitigation targets and actions (UNFCCC 2010a and 2010b). Several countries in Asia also pledged mitigation actions, with China committing to reduce GHG emissions per unit of GDP by 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 (Table 1.1). Although a global agreement is yet to be reached, member states agreed to the establishment of a “Green Climate Fund, "" with a goal to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 to assist developing countries in migitation and adaptation. A GHG mitigation-only pathway is not sufficient to attain LCE, however, as some degree of climate change and its impacts are inevitable. Climate risks and resilience should be integrated into sectoral development planning (Chapter 9) and appropriate adaptation measures in different sectors - agriculture, energy, water, health, tourism, and others - must be promoted. Adjustments to agricultural practices, changes in the design of energy, water and tourism infrastructure, and developing defenses against new diseases and epidemics are also critical. © 2012 selection and editorial material, Ancha Srinivasan, Frank Hiroshi Ling and Hideyuki Mori; individual chapters, the contributors.",,English,Book chapter,1025,11,Rural Resource Management

Discussion then moves on to how research in volunteer tourism has reflected those changes. Studies have focused on the transition from decommodified to commodified volunteer tourism; participant motivation, including the altruism versus self-development discussion; and the paucity of a unified and cohesive theoretical foundation in volunteer tourism. Fresh debates are now emerging that center upon the potential interface of technology and volunteer tourism, including crowd-sourcing for funding, smart phone apps, and GIS; the importance of monitoring and maintaining quality volunteer tourism experiences through certification and/or other indicators; and the role of religion and spirituality in volunteer tourism. These issues, and others, including the role of transformative learning, are addressed in the papers chosen for this special issue on volunteer tourism which are reviewed here. The paper's conclusions include specific recommendations for greater cooperation between researchers and industry to create a more sustainable industry, minimizing its negative impacts while maximizing its potential influence for positive social change, and perhaps becoming the ultimate sustainable form of tourism. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","altruism; ecotourism; GIS; information technology; religion; social change, information technology; responsible tourism; tourism and religion; volunteer tourism; WWOOFing",English,Article,206,11,Rural Resource Management

It demonstrates the feasibility and simplicity of applying a trip-chaining method to infer passenger journeys from smart card transactions data. Not only origins and destinations of passenger journeys can be inferred but also the interchanges between the segments of a linked journey can be recognised. The attributes of the corresponding routes, such as in-vehicle travel time, transfer walking time and to get from alighting stop to trip destination, the need to change, and the time headway of the first transportation line, can be determined by the combination of smart card data with other data sources, such as a street map and timetable. The smart card data represent a large volume of revealed preference data that allows travellers' behaviour to be modelled with higher accuracy than by using traditional survey data.

What connects the museum at 19 Princelet Street to the concept of the ecomuseum, which appeared on the French museological scene in the 1970s, is their approach: they both aim to relate the connections between tangible (objects, architecture) and intangible heritage (customs, beliefs, skills) in order to ‘preserve and deepen a sense of place’ (Davis 2004: 368) and a collective identity that is based on a people’s relationship to a place.

In the U.S., the rise of anti-sprawl smart growth and the environmental concerns about transportation show that the growing preference for accessibility is connected to interest in urban environment. However, in China, researches have reported the decreasing accessibility to facilities brought by rapid urbanization. Meanwhile, the increasing selectivity in preferences may further reduce accessibility. So far there has been little research on the general preference of different households for living environment; less is known about which households are experiencing a state of incongruence between their preference and reality. This paper is concerned with several aspects of accessibility to various daily life activities and destinations (education, health services, shopping, recreation space and food outlets). The paper has three aims. First, it is to analyze whether the preference for accessibility varies across socio-economic characteristics. Second, it is to measure the objective accessibility across different locations and housing types. Third, it is to identify the determinants of incongruence between people's preference and reality. Particularly, we are interested in the influence of urban temporal and spatial development, as well as housing access types. Our micro data comes from a large-scale 2005 residential satisfaction survey conducted in the city of Beijing. We also adopted GIS-based measures of objective accessibility and related it to a respondent's satisfaction levels. Evidence generated from this study will shed some light on the problem of social justice in urban space. Moreover, it can contribute to the debate on urban sprawl and housing reform.

This paper explores route viability using real-time link travel time data obtained from Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) devices in Daegu City, South Korea. The purpose of this study was to quantify the quality of alternative routes by explicitly considering route travel time variability. To demonstrate the practical implication of the proposed route viability, a few origin and destination pairs were selected, the distributions of shortest travel time routes (i.e., the best and the second best routes) were generated, and the viability of the shortest routes were compared on the basis of the viability index. It was found that the shortest route based on average travel time is not always the best route due to travel time variability as such viability index will help travelers understand the quality of the routes.","Cellular telephone systems; Dedicated short range communications; Intelligent systems; Mobile phones; Navigation systems; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Link travel time; Location-based technologies; Origin and destinations; Route guidance; Route viability; Shortest route; Shortest travel time; Travel time variabilities; Travel time, Link travel time; Route guidance; Route viability; Shortest route",English,Conference paper,203,4,Mobility and Transportation

When a traveller uses a public transport smart card, the exact time of their passage through ticket gates are recorded in the smart card system database. However, these data have not yet been sufficiently studied in the field of transport research. The aims of this paper are to estimate the behaviour of railway passengers by using smart card data and to evaluate the effects of train operations. In particular, the analysis is focused on the comparison of passengers' travel choice behaviour before and after the railway company altered the train timetable. This paper describes how the passing times of individual passengers at entrance and exit ticket gates are aggregated for a small discrete time interval. Analysis of the departure, travel, and arrival time distributions shows that passengers smoothly adjusted their travel behaviour to the new train timetable. Analysis of the passing times at origin and destination station ticket gates in combination with the train timetable makes it possible to identify which train each traveller was likely to have boarded. This paper also proposes a method to assign a passenger to a combination of trains between an origin and destination stations. The method is examined using actual smart card data. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Railroad transportation; Railroads; Scheduling; Transportation charges; Arrival-time distributions; Behavioural changes; Discrete time intervals; Global scale; Origin and destinations; Public transport; Public transport fares; Railway company; Railway passenger; System database; Train operations; Train timetables; Transport research; Travel behaviour; Smart cards, Railway passenger; Smart card data; Train timetable; Travel behaviour",English,Article,228,4,Mobility and Transportation

The aim is to improve the process of designing the routes to follow by a heterogeneous fleet of trucks that transport a large number of vehicles (of different features (volume, cost, etc.), from 8 major origins to more than 3,000 possible destinations spread both across the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), and some destinations in the rest of Europe (mainly France and Germany). The pursued improvements compared to the current situation, embrace the maximum occupancy of trucks, the total travelled distance, reduction of delivery times, minimization of distance travelled with minimal or no occupation of the truck, etc. Firstly a review of the methodologies currently used for the resolution of this type of problem is presented. Within the VRP problems (Vehicle Routing Problem), our case can be classified as a hybrid between the VRPTW problem (VRP with Time Windows) and the MDVRP (Multi Depot VRP, VRP with multiple locations). After analyzing both the exact and the approximate resolution methods, delving more into the latter given that they better conform to the problem that concerns us, the paper review different types of algorithms: local search, two stages, evolutionary, GRASP, smart colonies and solutions with multi-agent systems. Among them, GRASP algorithm was finally chosen for the problem resolution. Furthermore, a friendly WEB application has been developed to be offered to the operator responsible for the design of the routes. The Web will provide the operator with possible solutions for him to evaluate and validate based on their experience. After a series of tests, the use of this optimization tool reveals to bring improved solutions, par ticularly as regards the reduction of the delivery times and maximization of the occupation of the trucks. One of the main problems in current operations is the delay in the delivery of some orders, when there is no enough demand to fill a truck. The application resolves this problem by placing vehicles in trucks that are already filled with highly demanded vehicles for a nearby target. The delay in any of these specific vehicles to give out to the isolated ones is a preferred solution. Another problem that the application solves is the minimization of the distance travelled empty, ensuring that the end of the routes, are close to loading points. In shor t, although the application is still in testing phase, it has offered an important aid to the operator responsible for the routes design.",", Ar tificial intelligence; Heuristics; Route calculation",Spanish,Article,430,4,Mobility and Transportation

The original trip stop and destination stop can be accurately recorded when using public transportation in Korea, especially within the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). This data can be used to calibrate path choices based on the stochastic transit assignment model, which can describe passenger behaviour more precisely. However, the model has to decide the alternative path set in a huge network. This paper reviews search methods of multiple reasonable paths to implement multimodal public transportation assignment models with the network of Seoul. With a large scale multimodal public transportation network such as Seoul, the computation time of a path finding algorithm is key, and the resulting paths should reflect the route choice behavior of the public transportation passengers. Search methods of alternative paths are divided into the removing path method and the deviation path method. In order to apply path finding algorithms to public transportation networks, transfer and loop constraints must be included to be able to reflect real behavior. To validate the availability of the algorithms, experiments conducted with Seoul metropolitan public multimodal transportation network consisted of 41,950 nodes and 171,176 links by using the deviation path method, which is suitable for a large-scale network. © Civil-Comp Press, 2012","K-shortest path algorithm; Seoul; Smart card; Transit assignment, Multimodal transportation; Smart cards; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; K-shortest path algorithms; Multimodal transportation networks; Path-finding algorithms; Public transportation; Public transportation networks; Seoul; Seoul metropolitan area; Transit assignment; Transportation routes",English,Article,212,4,Mobility and Transportation

This study uses the results of a discrete choice experiment to investigate likely skier responses to various destination scenarios under possible adaptation strategies to climate change. The heterogeneity of skiers is accounted for in a latent class model resulting in three segments of Austrian and Finnish skiers respectively. The results show that it is less risky for Austrian destinations to introduce technical adaptation, as well as to expand into additional offers, compared to Finland. The main reasons seem to be the strong tradition of cross-country skiing in Finland combined with a clear aversion toward user fees.

37091594300; 47061721700,Pattern of urban services concentration and its environmental impacts on Tehran city,2012,"Principles of Sustainable development have been considered in three dimensions: social, economic and environmental. Problems such as high level of population increase, high level of resources consumption and population concentration in urban areas, make the achievement of sustainable future more difficult. Currently, more than 50% of population live in urban areas, and by 2020, this number will reach to 60%. The role of cities in achieving sustainable development is quite important, since large cities are the consumers of natural resources. In fact they are the producers of pollution sources, and the place of human activities concentration. Thus, urban management is an important issue. One of the controversial issues is urban sprawl. There are numerous definitions of urban sprawl. In summary, urban sprawl has been defined as unplanned sprawl, uncontrolled expansion, mono-functional land use, low density and discontinuous land use. Some of the consequences of urban sprawl are occupying green spaces around cities, high costs of infrastructure, high level of energy use, social segregation, car dependency, traffic increase, pollution, temperature increase and decrease in air and water quality. Materials and Methods The major goal of this paper is to examine the relationship between urban sprawl, measured by the pattern of concentration of urban facilities and utilities, and its environmental impacts on Tehran. This research is focused on examining the impact of Tehran's urban sprawl on four environmental variables: (1) Air pollution, (2) Temperature, (3) land cover vegetation and (4) sound pollution. The conceptual model of the research is built on these assumptions that the pattern of urban transportation and urban trips are the results of the urban facilities and urban services distribution, jobs and housing, and they affect the number, length and types of trips occurred within a city. Another assumption is that the pattern of transportation infrastructure and the availability of urban public transportation determine the degree of using private cars. Since urban facilities are concentrated in the central part of Tehran, while housing units are located in the outer layers of the city, urban sprawl and urban transportation are not adequately available and effective. Thus, private car dependency has increased. In recent years, Tehran has experienced urban sprawl. The current trend is towards more decentralization of population, longer trips and private car dependency, and the expansion of transportation infrastructure. Increase in the distance between home and working, shopping, and educational places, and lack of effective public transportation have increased the tendency for using private cars. One of the most important consequences is environmental problems, such as increase in air pollution, the amounts of impervious lands and sound pollution, and decrease in water quality and urban green spaces. This research examines the relationship between the pattern of urban facilities distribution and its impacts on environmental variables. Air pollution: Increase in the use of car can increase the level of carbon dioxide, particles, nitrogen, and hydrocarbon in the air, which can cause breathing, and other health problems. It can damage buildings, and aesthetic aspects of cities. It is assumed that accessibility to major urban services: educational, emergency, health, cultural and recreational facilities are the major causes of commuting. Study showed that these facilities are concentrated in the central parts of Tehran city. Distances with the urban facilities were measured for different regions in the city. Distance to different urban facilities (educational, emergency, health, cultural, recreational, and subway stations) were weighted. Accessibility to emergency facilities has the highest weight and educational facilities have the next highest weight. Accessibility to subway stations, recreational facilities, and cultural facilities have the third, equal weights and accessibility to health facilities has the fourth rank. The highest degree of accessibility to these facilities belongs to central regions of Tehran city. Accessibility to urban facilities decreases with distance from center. Moran index was also used to measure the pattern of distribution of urban facilities. Moran index shows that urban facilities are clustered in the central part of Tehran. Hotspot analysis was used to find the degree of variation of areas regarding the distance from urban facilities. This pattern of decreasing the availability of urban facilities with increasing the distance from center creates more frequent using of private cars, and as a result more air pollution. The results of study show that the highest degree of pollution exists in central areas of the city. The northern regions have least amount of air pollution, because of less commuting to these regions. Temperature: In hot days, urban areas are about 6 to 8 degrees warmer than the surrounding areas. This creates a situation called heat island. Heat islands are created because of two reasons: the dark color of asphalt on the roofs and roads which absorb more heat; and loss of land cover vegetation which usually has shadow and cools the weather. The distribution of high temperature points in the city shows that the southern and central parts of the city have temperatures higher than the average. The central parts of Tehran are destinations for commuting. Region 1 in North of Tehran has the lowest temperature.- Sound Pollution: The results of research show that noise causes changes in the physiologic system such as increasing blood pressure, loss of concentrating ability and loss of memory. To analyze the impacts of commuting on sound pollution, distances from highways, major roads, rails, and airport were used as indicators of pollution sources. Distances from highways, railroads and airport were weighted. The distances from airport have the highest weights. The distances from major highways stand in the second place. The study shows that the highest amounts of sound pollution occur in central, western and southern parts of the city and the least amounts of sound pollution are observed in North of Tehran. Land cover vegetation: Green spaces filter urban pollution, increase aesthetic aspects of city, increase underground waters, and are good habitats for natural wildlife. Green spaces also improve the quality of life. Results of previous studies show that green environment improves the physical and emotional conditions of individuals. Urban sprawl causes the fragmentation and loss of green spaces. Remote sensing data were used to analyze the distribution of green space in Tehran. Arc GIS was used to present the areal statistics for vegetation cover. The highest amount of vegetation is observed in the northern part of the city and the lowest amount is observed in the central part. Regression analysis was used to measure the association between the distance from CBD and environmental variables (air pollution, temperature, sound pollution, and land cover vegetation). The results show that there is a positive correlation between population density and accessibility to urban facilities (0.561).There is also a positive correlation between air pollution and accessibility to urban facilities. The result shows that there is a negative correlation between air pollution and vegetation. There is also a negative correlation between vegetation and temperature. Conclusion General concern about the impacts of urban sprawl on environmental, economic, and social variables has led to considering the urban land use pattern. Urban sprawl with high level of dispersion and shortage of resources in developing countries is one of the events that have received urban planner's attention. In this article, the pattern of distribution of urban facilities and their impacts on the environmental Variables (air pollution, land cover vegetation, sound pollution and temperature) were studied. The results of study show that Tehran has experienced urban sprawl in recent years. Urban sprawl has happened while there has been no plan for decentralization of urban services and urban services are concentrated in the central part of the city. Results of Moran Index and Geary Index show the significant concentration of urban facilities in the central parts of Tehran. High concentration of urban services in central parts of the city and lack of efficient urban transit system have caused high levels of private car dependency to reach to urban facilities. This has led to environmental impacts such as occupying green spaces, higher level of air pollution, higher temperature, and sound pollution. The results of this study show that this commuting has caused air pollution, increase in temperature, sound pollution and losing land cover vegetation in Tehran. Urban sprawl, increase of distance between home or work place and urban facilities has encouraged the use of private cars. Pearson analysis shows correlation between the distribution patterns of urban facilities and environmental variables. There is significant positive correlation between the accessibility to urban facilities and population density and air pollution. There is a significant negative correlation between land cover vegetation and accessibility to urban facilities. Investments in transportation infrastructure, promoting urban transportation, and well-planned distribution of urban services are recommended. According to the literature about urban sprawl cites, urban sprawl is not an urban pattern but an urban process and it matters to determine that at which phase of urban development Tehran is. Tehran like many other cities in developing countries is in the stage of urban growth and urban expansion. This process is inevitable. Considering the principles of smart growth and the application of them can be a good policy guide for urban and regional planners.",", Accessibility; Air pollution; Land covers vegetation; Land surface temperature; Sound pollution",Persian,Article,1506,3,Urban Sustainability
55017070000,Tourism in Indonesia: The end of the new order,2012,"Since the 1960s the focal point of Indonesian economic development has been a series of fiveyear development plans known as Repelita. Repelita VI began in April 1994. During Repelita IV, at the end of 1987, inbound visitation hit the 1 million mark for the first time (see Table 11.1). During the period 1984-1988, US$918.6 million in foreign money and Rp2.15 billion from local interests funded a total of 264 investments, including 182 hotels, 40 recreational facilities, 21 travel bureaus, 10 marine resorts and 11 restaurants (Teh and Wong, 1989). In 1989 tourism represented 5.8 per cent of exports earnings, compared with 2.8 per cent in 1985 (Economist Intelligence Unit, 1991). In 1989 the Directorate General of Tourism set a target of at least 2.5 million arrivals and US$2.25-3.15 billion in foreign exchange earnings by the end of the Repelita V period. The target of 2.5 million arrivals had been reached by 1991 although they only produced US$969 million in revenue (Hall, 1997). By 1995 Indonesia was attracting over 4.3 million visitor arrivals, producing an estimated US$5.31 billion in revenue (World Tourism Organization, 1996). In 1997 the 5.04 million arrivals, substantially lower than the projected 5.3 million, brought in an estimated US$6.62 billion in foreign exchange earnings (TravelAsia, 1998b). © 2000, C.

However, it is not always easy to obtain it because OD surveys are expensive and difficult to implement. This is particularly relevant in large cities with congested networks, where detailed zonification and time disaggregation require large sample sizes and complicated survey methods. Therefore, the incorporation of information technology in some public transport systems around the world is an excellent opportunity for passive data collection.

The study included identification of candidate applications and technologies and the formation of a staged implementation schedule by considering prioritization of corridors and ITS technologies, focusing on the most urgent needs in the most troubled areas and corridors, while considering various organizational issues and the stakeholders affected.","Automobiles; Commercial vehicles; Electronic data interchange; Intelligent systems; Traffic control; Truck transportation; Trucks; Heavy-truck traffic; Intelligent transportation systems; Logistics centres; Organizational issues; Prioritization; Safety and securities; Transportation of goods; Urban traffic management; Commercial vehicle operations, Commercial vehicles; Data exchange; Economy and trade; Safety and security; Urban traffic management",English,Conference paper,184,4,Mobility and Transportation
7401466601; 57243524400; 22957391700,Creating an evaluation platform to deliver sustainable urban networks using bluetooth technology,2012,"Current research (Cairns, 2012) demonstrates that vehicle emissions reduction technologies alone will neither deliver carbon emissions targets (CCA, 2008) nor EU air quality objectives. Therefore, modal shift, demand management and behavioural changes need to be at the heart of future policies with emphasis on efficient and effective movement of people rather than single occupancy vehicles. By reporting network problems, by way of APPs, to mobiles and iPhones drivers are informed of less congested routes, and are given directions to car parks, while passengers receive information on availability of bus services in real-time, thereby reducing vehicle-miles, emissions, speeding up journeys and unnecessary delay at bus stop, potentially this can be delivered by Bluetooth technology operating in an Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) environment. This paper focusses on demonstrating the usefulness of Bluetooth sensors in delivering sustainability. It is aimed at enhancing network efficiency by developing an insight into monitored Bluetooth signals from a network of sensors distributed over part of an urban area of Birtley, UK, employing a post-processing data analysis technique. From the analysis, the study of spatial and temporal status monitoring of the network helped to assess journey times and gain knowledge of routes irrespective of the mode. The preliminary results and analysis indicate that Bluetooth can establish the distribution of journey times to a level of accuracy capable of differentiating the proportion of vehicles in different traffic conditions. This enables more realistic estimates of pollutant emissions to be made link by link. The ability to identify routes through the network (origins and destinations) offers the potential to considerably enhance decision making with regard to managing traffic demand and providing information to users of the network across modes. Future work includes system calibration, validation and real time deployment to enable traffic optimisation and emissions reduction to be achieved.","Air quality; Behavioral research; Bluetooth; Bus transportation; Emission control; Sensors; Traffic control; Vehicles; Bluetooth technology; Data analysis techniques; Emissions reduction; Evaluation platforms; Intelligent transport systems; Journey time; Network efficiency; Single occupancy vehicles; Sustainable development, Bluetooth technology; Journey times; Network efficiency; Sustainability",English,Conference paper,298,4,Mobility and Transportation
NoID,A computational analysis of shortest path algorithms for integrated transit and automobile trip planning,2013,"While there are many journey planners in use around the world, the vast majority of them focus solely on optimising trips for the transit network, which is based on routes and timetables, or on optimising trips on the road network for drivers of personal vehicles. By integrating these two networks together into a single journey, the Multimodal Multiobjective Trip Planner (MMTP) in development at the Smart Transport Research Centre (STRC), Queensland University of Technology, can provide more flexibility to users on how they travel to their destination. The primary goal of this paper is to present an analysis of the computational performance of the shortest path algorithms that have been implemented for the MMTP. The algorithms that are used will be outlined, as well as the graph structures that they search. The method for integrating the two networks into a combined trip plan will be discussed. Results will then be presented from tests performed on the Brisbane transit and road networks. This will be followed by an analysis of these results, by comparing the performance of the algorithms for the different categories of journeys that could be experienced by the trip planner in practical use.",", Graph theory; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Computational analysis; Computational performance; Graph structures; Personal vehicles; Queensland university of technologies; Shortest path algorithms; Transit networks; Transport research; Algorithms",English,Conference paper,195,4,Mobility and Transportation

The complexity of interaction among ecological, economic and political variables and a widespread lack of data availability lead to difficulty in bringing together large scale analysis and local planning systems. This loop can be solved through flexible tools able to relate large scale environmental assessment with medium and small scale DSS, useful for local decisions makers.The present research aims at creating a spatial model, based on Geographic Information Systems (GISs), capable to quantify the potential amount of woody biomass from forest sector at several evaluation scales, to consider the theoretical impact of biomass removal on forest multifunctionality and to estimate the potential trade-off between forest functions in case of bioenergy chain development.The model is carried out basing on multifunctionality aspects and their potential relationship with biomass energy production. The forest functions considered in the model are: (i) soil and water protection, (ii) biodiversity and habitat conservation, (iii) fire risk prevention, (iv) tourist and recreational function and (v) economic evaluation related to timber and bioenergy processing. The structure of the model is based on sub-models that enable biomass chain analysis from large scale to small scale. Large scale analysis is developed using forest yield data, protected areas and main and forest roads localization, geomorphological variables and fire risk maps. An increase of input data (economic and logistic variables) is requested for medium and small scale analysis. The model is tested from national (Italy) to regional (Tuscany region in Central Italy) and provincial scale (province of Trento in North-Eastern Italian Alps). Results stress how the model can be able to depict territorial differences in several contexts and to consider respective influence on estimation of biomass availability. Finally, the Compromise Programming (CP) methodology permits defining the optimal quantity of residues removal in different compartments according to priority forest function. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Forest bioenergy; GIS modeling; Multifunctionality trade-off; Multiscale analysis, Italy; Artificial intelligence; Availability; Biodiversity; Biomass; Decision support systems; Fire protection; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Geologic models; Maps; Soil conservation; Statistics; Bio-energy; Bio-mass energy; Bioenergy chains; Biomass availability; Biomass removal; Central Italy; Chain analysis; Compromise programming; Data availability; Economic evaluations; Environmental assessment; Fire risks; Flexible tool; Forest function; Forest roads; Forest sectors; GIS modeling; GIS models; Habitat conservation; Input datas; Large-scale analysis; Local decisions; Local planning; Multi scale analysis; Multifunctionality; Multiscales; Optimal quantity; Political variables; Protected areas; Small scale; Soil and water; Spatial models; Submodels; Trade-off analysis; Tuscany; Woody biomass; bioenergy; biomass power; data set; decision support system; economic analysis; environmental assessment; GIS; model test; numerical model; planning system; power generation; trade-off; Economic analysis",English,Article,318,11,Rural Resource Management
40662138600,Threat and risk: What is the difference and why does it matter?,2012,"Since the events of 9/11 the terms 'threat' and 'risk' have entered the daily lexicon to a greater extent than ever before. News media report on changes to national threat assessments, commenting when the threat level rises from 'Moderate' to 'Substantial', in the case of the United Kingdom. The British government recently released a document that provided details of the issues that pose the highest risk to the national infrastructure. All of these are based, so we are told, on the work of the national intelligence agencies. But what are these indicators actually telling us and what is the relationship between threat assessments and risk assessments? These are both important questions because important decisions aremade as a result of changes in these assessments. National defence and security planning is based upon perceived threats and risks. An entire risk management industry has grown up in the business world that covers everything from health and safety to financial risk. It is not only governments and businesses that base decisions on these indicators, but individuals as well. Tourists planning holidays in Europe were alarmed when the British, French and German governments increased their threat levels in response to intelligence that suggested that an attack against tourist sites in their respective capitals was imminent. Some will have changed their plans and travelled elsewhere, to the detriment of the tourist industry, while otherswill have chosen to defy the terrorists and travel anyway - potentially placing themselves in harm's way.With so much at stake, both nationally and individually, it is therefore important that we understand the difference between a 'threat' and a 'risk' and, as scholars of intelligence, the role that intelligence plays in assessing them. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",,English,Article,285,3,Urban Sustainability
35809721600; 57198790979,A viability model for digital cities: Economic and acceptability factors,2012,"Digital cities concern metropolitan environments, where the ICT contribute to various local challenges and to the improvement of everyday life. These environments have evolved from usual broadband environments to mesh social spaces, which combine e-services, collaboration applications, crowd sourcing, and information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures. Digital cities vary from web to smart ones and their implementation is based on particular strategic priorities. Today, most digital cities focus on ubiquitous computing and on Web 2.0 applications for the delivery of various e-services (e.g. e-tourism, e-security, e-health, and tele-care services) in the city area. In this context, digital cities are more likely to be considered as favorable environments for entrepreneurship and for social participation. However, a digital city is a complex and large-scale project; it demands viable analysis and planning in order to secure its sustainability and its adoption by the local community. In contrast to other ICT projects, managers have enough opportunities to revise and to transform their strategy, their plans, and their templates during its implementation. This chapter focuses on the economic and to the social considerations in the uses of Web 2.0 applications by Governments. It summarizes the most accepted forms of digital cities and their Web 2.0 applications. Moreover, it presents the most significant considerations for economic and social success of a digital city and it determines a viability model for such a project. The viability model contains qualitative decision factors and it is adaptive for different digital city cases. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012.",", Delphi method; Qualitative factor; Smart city; Social participation; Viability model",English,Book chapter,250,3,Urban Sustainability
57193026967,Part iv: Planning and community action,2012,"Within the literature on tourism, an ongoing debate has continued on the extent to which tourism planning exists as a discrete and integrated activity within the public and private sector (Page and Thorn, 1997, 1998). While a range of tourism texts now exist on the theme of tourism planning (Gunn, 1979; Inskeep, 1991, 1994; Gartner, 1996; Hall et aI., 1997; Wilkinson, 1997), in only a few contexts (e.g. Languedoc-Roussillon) does tourism planning exist as a specialist and integrated activity (Getz, 1986). In many cases, tourism planning is an all-embracing term used to encompass a wide variety of activities, often including tourist development (see Pearce, 1989). This makes any definitive analysis of the field of study complex, and an almost impossible task to review in a coherent and meaningful manner. This is made even more complex when considering new paradigms that approach tourism planning from the planning literature perspective (Hall, 1999). In fact Hall's (1999) new and stimulating review attempts to avoid sterile, check list and pedantic reviews of tourism planning by placing people, politics and the irrational explanations ofplanning decisions as central to his thesis. © 2000 Taylor & Francis.

56459854100,Jockeying for position: What it means and why it matters to regional development policy when places compete,2012,"The realization that places compete for investment has expanded in recent years to encompass competition among places for the attention of migrants, tourists and media glow as well as investment. The most competitive places have been multidimensional in their attractions and have made the transition to the knowledge-based economy. The latest priority is being placed on attracting mobile workers and mobile investment. Creative workers are the core of the knowledge economy and of its geographies such as ‘intelligent places’ and ‘learning regions’. Knowledge metrics, innovation indices and report cards are increasingly common, each seemingly developed to sort the list of places in a different order. Lists or league tables of ‘the best places’ for business, to live, retire and visit are key features of economies and societies whose factors of success are highly mobile. Competition in a geographical context and entrepreneurial responses are unlikely to go away, reinforced by an industry comprised of consultancies, the trade press, formal education and other means of learning. Consequently, policy-makers need to grasp the nature of place competition and the critical roles of knowledge and of networks in the strategies of the most competitive places. The standard of competition is complex, comprising innovation indices and cooperation within the network of world cities. © 2006 Regional Studies Association.",", Competition; Knowledge; Policy; Regional development; World cities",English,Book,213,11,Rural Resource Management

During the last 30 days over 5,000,000 new logs have been submitted worldwide, disseminating individual experiences, motivations, emotions and photos through the official Geocaching website (www.geocaching.com), and several official or informal national web forums. The activity itself can be compared with modern treasure hunting that uses handheld GPS, Smartphones or Tablets, WEB 2.0, wiki features and technologies to keep Geocachers engaged with their activity, in a strong social-network. All these characteristics make Geocaching an activity with a strong geographic component that deals closely with the surrounding environment where each cache has been hidden. From previous work, significance correlation has been found regarding hides and natural/rural environments, but metropolitan and urban areas like Lisbon municipality (that holds 3.23% of the total 27534 Portuguese caches), still registers the higher density of Geocaches, and logs numbers. Lacking ""natural/rural"" environment, Geocaching in cities tend to happen in symbolic areas, like public parks and places, sightseeing spots and historical neighborhoods. The present study looks to Geocaching within the city of Lisbon, in order to understand how it works, and if this activity reflects the city itself, promoting its image and cultural heritage. From a freely available dataset that includes all Geocaches that have been placed in Lisbon since February 2001, spatial analysis has been conducted, showing the informal preferences of this activity. Results show a non-random distribution of caches within the study area, similar to the land use distribution. Preferable locations tend to be in iconic places of the city, usually close to the Tagus River, that concentrates 25% of the total caches. Since most of these places are known to be touristic destinations, the TOP15 logged Caches were also analyzed regarding their description and logs in order to understand if Geocaching reflects tourism and if it works as a tourist promotion tool within urban environments. Final results also reflect the Geocaching performance and major trends within urban environments providing new insights regarding this activity impacts and implications.","Geocaching; GIS; Recreational activities; Spatial Analysis; Urban environments, Geographic information systems; Land use; Social sciences computing; Spatial variables measurement; Urban planning; Geocache; Geocaching; Handhelds; Recreational activities; Rural environment; Smart phones; Spatial analysis; United States of America; Urban environments; Web Forums; Motivation",English,Conference paper,362,3,Urban Sustainability

The Kizilirmak Delta in the Central Black Sea region is defined as a Ramsar Area by virtue of its natural habitats and rich biodiversity. The delta has very important wetlands whose natural features have been well-preserved. One of these wetlands, Lakes Cernek and Balik, constitutes a significant ecosystem in terms of agriculture, tourism and fishing. The ecosystem of the lakes are gradually getting degenerated due to irrigation, sedimentary residues, and contamination by agricultural and domestic waste and therefore the tropic level of the lakes are faced with a serious problem. Environmental models provide a quick evaluation of the relationships between reasons and the impacts of pollution. Therefore the models are in the need of estimation of the effects of eutrophication over the aquatic ecosystems. The permission of generating the future scenarios is the major advantage of models. The eutrophication problem in shallow lakes is different from deep lakes which are more common. In this study, which is one of our country is very important and sensitive ecosystems in the Kizilirmak Delta, in order to ensure sustainable management of Cernek and Balik lakes, decision-makers the information necessary for the decision support system is one of the tools that can be used in the design phase, water quality modelling is carried out.

The implementation of sustainable development principles in themanagement of coastal areas is a major issue toward their durability.A plethora of studies and operational experiences address the wider issues ofsustainable resource management, mitigation of hazard and conflict and optimalallocation of resources. The authors develop innovative stakeholders-oriented approachesto facilitate decision-making in the coastal management of Nature-Society interactions.In this paper, we focus on Nature-Society interactions and use conflicts consideredas spatial objects and processes.

It is to be called L'Aquila. The wealthy of approximately 70 centers move to this new urban territory into sites allotted to them, to build the houses, the church and the public fountain in the square fronting it, maintaining the name of the original castle: thus the city becomes a collective entity, while maintaining multiple identities in its focal points, the various parochial churches. Recurring earthquakes are another aspect of the city's identity. In order to augment and restructure the urban fabric and improve it by means of new strategies, the citizens follow the policy of a sacred identity in the fourteenth century with construction of the complex of Santa Maria di Collemaggio which Pope Celestine V, granting the plenary indulgence «la Perdonanza», included among the pilgrimage destinations, and in the fifteenth century with that of the Osservante.

The Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal is the most comprehensive global environmental agreement on hazardous and other wastes; which aims to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects resulting from the generation, management, transboundary movements and disposal of hazardous and other wastes (http://www.basel.int/). In the 1990s the focus was set on the control over toxic substances by means of smart design for recycling and manual disassembly of hazardous components in the recycling phase itself. Experiences of the last ten years show that electronic waste policies should serve multiple and broader societal goals. Developments in shredding and separation technologies have led to the realisation that dismantling as such does not bring the desired toxic control, as it depends much more on the destination of disassembled components, and there are relatively high costs involved. The recovery of valuable materials and energy preservation has also become much more important. There is an obvious change in thinking and approach to WEEE (Puja Sawhney et. al. 2008).

Despite such conditions, powerful growth coalitions can still manipulate the development process so that projects are altered to serve their own interests. This research examines how an innovative infill project in Colorado Springs devolved into a very traditional, automobile-oriented big-box shopping center unlikely to serve the needs of students or create a lively destination site. We analyze the strategies of powerful stakeholders and public agencies during the development process to determine how such a breakdown could occur. We conclude that a deregulated political culture empowers the growth machine coalition to define the ""reality"" of what can and cannot be built, perpetuating the creation of placeless, generic landscapes insensitive to local site characteristics or alternative visions.","Colorado; Colorado Springs; United States; cultural influence; deregulation; development project; empowerment; landscape planning; stakeholder; strategic approach; urban development; urban growth; urban renewal; village, cultural politics; growth machine; infill; placelessness",English,Article,147,3,Urban Sustainability

56053840300,"Poverty, development, and violent extremism in weak states",2010,"In October 2000, a 35-foot craft approached the U.S.S Cole, docked in Aden Harbor, Yemen. Operated by two Saudi suicide terrorists, the small boat was packed with about 600 pounds of powerful explosives. Within minutes, the bombers triggered a blast that ripped through the metal hull of the 9,100-ton vessel, a U.S. Navy destroyer. The explosion killed seventeen American sailors and injured thirty-nine others. It was powerful enough to rattle buildings surrounding the port. While responsibility for the attacks was initially unclear, law enforcement agencies eventually traced them to Osama bin Laden, who, according to the 9/11 Commission, directly supervised, helped plan, and funded the operation.1 Immediately after the U.S.S. Cole attack, the Clinton administration assigned high priority to counterterrorism cooperation in Yemen. After 9/11, U.S. policy focused on special operations missions in Yemen to help track and capture or kill al Qaeda suspects. U.S.-Yemeni intelligence prompted a 2002 U.S. missile strike in Yemen that blew up a car occupied by a top al Qaeda leader. Yemen received U.S. security assistance, including funding to help rebuild its coast guard and monitor land borders, as well as financial and operational support for Yemeni special operations and other military forces, which resulted in numerous arrests.2 Initially, U.S. and Yemeni counterterrorism initiatives seemed to pay off: several terrorist plots were foiled, and the capture of al Qaeda leaders was hailed as a serious blow to the group's leadership and capabilities in Yemen.3 Yet by 2006 the tide had begun to turn back. Analysts warned of a second generation of al Qaeda-inspired militants taking root in Yemen. A sharp increase in terrorist attacks soon followed.4 In 2008 a local cell calling itself al Qaeda in Yemen (AQY) twice attacked the U.S. embassy compound in the capital of Sana, killing two Yemenis in a March rocket attack and seventeen people-including one American- in a September bombing plot.5 Other plots linked to al Qaeda have targeted foreign oil workers and facilities, a residential compound housing Americans and other foreign residents, army checkpoints, and tourists visiting the country.6 Saudi Arabia announced in 2009 that many of its most-wanted militants had taken refuge in neighboring Yemen, including the regional leader of al Qaeda.7 Why, eight years after the 9/11 attacks and despite ongoing and initially effective U.S. and Yemeni counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda's leadership, does the country remain a hot spot for violent extremism? This question has implications far beyond Yemen and bears on Islamic violent extremism globally. Violent extremism should not be construed as the only important transnational threat to U.S. security, as other chapters in this book indicate. Yet the U.S. fight against violent extremism remains a top foreign policy priority and is one we must get right. As even hawkish Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld remarked in 2003, our current approach begs the question: is the United States ""capturing, killing or deterring more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?""8 To understand why terrorist activity persists in countries like Yemen, one must move beyond intercepting terrorist leaders and bombers, and examine the conditions that allow violent extremists to operate and attract lower-level recruits and build popular support. Yemen country experts point to numerous drivers and enablers of terrorism, but the one that is increasingly gaining attention is poverty.9 Though situated on the oil-rich Arabian Peninsula, Yemen ranks among the most impoverished places in the world (it is poorer than Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, and the Republic of Congo) and is the world's sixth fastest-growing country (the population is set to double by 2020).10 The human development challenges that plague much of the Muslim world today-from low-quality education to lack of jobs, corruption, and a deficit of political liberties- all seem to be particularly acute in Yemen. Some warn that diminishing resources are undermining the government's capacity to mount effective counterterrorism operations and could cause the state to collapse.11 Yet the challenge for U.S. policymakers is how to reconcile the view of country experts who believe low income contributes to terrorism with that of terrorism experts who tend to dismiss poverty's role? Much has been written by country experts about the perils of persistent poverty in weak states such as Pakistan and in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Horn of Africa.12 Yet since 9/11, terrorism experts have invoked empirical evidence that poverty does not correlate with a higher incidence of terrorist attacks and participation. The consensus appears to be that poverty does not motivate individuals to participate in terrorism, and that development assistance, therefore, has no place in a long-term counterterrorism strategy. On the contrary, policymakers would be well advised to pay far greater attention to development's role in a long-term U.S. strategy against terrorism. The reality is that there simply is no robust empirical relationship between poverty and terrorist attacks, making it largely impossible to draw policy conclusions from this literature. To be sure, extremist groups exploit a variety of conditions across the world, even in wealthy industrialized states, where attacks have often involved educated, middle- class recruits. However, new evidence suggests that weak and failed states-many of which are among the world's poorest countries- are at increased risk of harboring violent extremists, that terrorist attacks are more deadly in poor countries, and that more attacks targeting Americans are occurring in the developing world. This chapter focuses on the vulnerabilities of weak states to extremism as a first step toward formulating more adequate, long-term strategies against violent extremism in the developing world. The United States must take the lead in making effective capacity building and poverty alleviation in weak states a priority. This has not been the case to date, except in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather, U.S. global counterterrorism strategy aims primarily at intercepting individual terrorists, at the expense of long-term gains in the wider fight against violent extremism. With extremist groups gaining ground across the Muslim world-not only in Yemen but also in North Africa and parts of Asia-this security-based approach appears to be backfiring. The recent global financial crisis may give violent extremists an additional boost, making even clearer the link between poverty, weak states, and terrorism in key parts of the developing world.13 In 2004 the 9/11 Commission concluded that a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy must ""include economic policies that encourage development . . . and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families.""14 Yet five years on, the United States is still far from such a strategy.15 In Yemen, for example, U.S. foreign assistance spending for several years amounted to roughly $12 per person, less than aid to comparably poor countries in Africa, and substantially less than assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan.16 Half of the approximately $20 million annual budget for Yemen in fiscal 2005-08 was spent on military and intelligence cooperation.17 What little the U.S. government did provide in nonmilitary assistance in 2008 was tied to the extradition of terrorists, including several U.S.S. Cole bombers.18 In a country whose population consistently ranks among the most anti-American in the world, this approach is not working.19 U.S. policy in Yemen continues to be largely one-sided, lacking a long-range plan to dissuade youths from joining extremist groups. As discussed in chapter 7 of this book, donor agencies must redouble their efforts to identify policy solutions that are effective in countries that lack institutional capacity and are unable to maintain or establish domestic security. © 2010 The Brookings Institution.

56538699100,Intelligence cooperation versus evidence collection and dissemination,2011,"One of the key roles of a government is the protection of its citizens from the threat of terrorism. This threat has become more prominent over recent years, and has been highlighted by a number of attacks, notably: United States (2001), the Madrid train bombings (2004), the Bali night club bombings (2002), Kula tourist district (2002), the London Underground bombs (2005) followed by the failed bombings on the London transport system (2007), the attacks on Glasgow International Airport (2007), the concurrent failed bomb explosion in the Haymarket, West End of London (2007), Mumbai (2008), and the more recent events in Kampala (2010). These events bring into sharp relief the importance of intelligence and intelligence-gathering techniques. The function of intelligence handling and development is critical to detecting, and ultimately preventing, terrorism both at the national and international level.

The convenience of such system has attracted a lot of frequent users. For example, the percent of bus passengers holding smart cards is almost 65% in the city of Jinan, China by the end of 2009. The log of payment activities is a rich source for transit planners' decision support. However, the most important information, Origin-Destination (OD) matrix of passenger demands of each bus route, cannot be easily determined because only boarding information is recorded on buses with fixed fares. This paper mainly focuses on providing an improved approach for estimating the passenger demand OD matrix for each bus route. First, necessary data filtering technique is applied to process the smart card data. Then, OD matrix of passenger trip is obtained by considering the connectivity and walking distance of individual transfer. Finally, passenger OD matrix for each bus route is estimated individually. Experiments were carried out with smart card data collected in Jinan, China on July 7, 2009. Results showed that the proposed approach provided a success rate of 75% in average for route OD matrix estimation, while reaching 85% in peak hours. The computed OD matrix is valuable to support trip demand estimation, bus dispatching and route optimization for planners and decision-makers.","Bus transportation; Buses; Decision making; Decision support systems; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Matrix algebra; Planning; Smart cards; Traffic control; Transportation; Decision supports; O-D matrix; Origin destination matrices; Origin-destination matrix; Passenger O-D matrix; Public transportation; Route optimization; Variant transfer distance; Transportation routes, Public transportation; Route OD matrix; Smart card data; Variant transfer distance",English,Conference paper,222,4,Mobility and Transportation
6507555977; 23037239200; 36845080100,How can tourism use land more efficiently? A model-based approach to land-use efficiency for tourist destinations,2011,"In densely populated areas of Central Europe, many successful tourist destinations face the problem of approaching the limit of their growth potential. Solutions to this problem commonly refer to the idea of "" smart growth"" based on increasing efficiency in the use of nature for economic production (eco-efficiency). In this paper, we show how eco-efficiency can be used to evaluate tourism strategies on local scale based on an augmented regional input-output model that delivers information on economic performance, land use (as indicator for environmental pressure), and employment. We illustrate this approach via a case study of the tourist destination of Davos in the Swiss Alps. The model predicts that the key drivers of land-use efficiency are: (i) the economic impact of tourists, (ii) occupancy intensity, and (iii) the density of beds per area covered by residential buildings and hotels. The economic impact of increasing bed capacity is highly dependent on the tourist category triggering the development; this can also be used to attract new tourist categories at the expense of tourist categories that make inefficient use of available land. As the impact of an increased density of beds per ground floor area is as high as an improved occupancy rate over during the year, spatial planning, building design, and facility management also play a major role in improving land efficiency in the tourism sector. © 2010.","Davos; Graubunden; Switzerland; ecotourism; input-output analysis; land use; model; spatial planning; strategic approach; tourism development; tourism management; tourist destination, Eco-efficiency; Input-output; Land use; Sustainable tourism",English,Article,226,11,Rural Resource Management

NoID,World textile and apparel trade and production trends: The EU,2010,"Textile and clothing output fell sharply in the EU in the first six months of 2009, and declined at double digit rates in almost all member states for which data are available. The falls reflected declining export demand for EU-made goods as well as falling domestic sales as a result of the global economic crisis and recession in many countries. Total exports to countries outside the EU were 17.9% lower, with sales of textiles down by 20.4% and clothing by 14.9%. Within the EU, Italy was the largest textile exporter, followed closely by Germany. The largest destination for EU textile exports was the USA, followed by Tunisia and Turkey. Italy was also the biggest exporter of clothing, followed at some distance by Germany and France. The largest destination for EU clothing exports was Switzerland, followed by Russia and the USA. Imports also fell significantly as EU consumer spending weakened, and retailers and distributors cut back on inventories. The fall also reflected weaker demand for raw materials as activity in the textile and clothing industry was curtailed. Total EU textile and clothing imports were down by 8.5% in value, reflecting a 12.7% fall in internal trade, although imports from outside the EU were down by only 3.5%. Of the total, textile imports from outside the EU fell in value by 18.2%. Clothing imports from outside the EU, on the other hand, rose in value by 2.3% but fell in volume by 7.7%, reflecting a rise in the average import price. The leading external supplier of textiles was China, followed by Turkey and India. In clothing, the leading supplier was China followed by Turkey, Bangladesh and India. Many suppliers increased their prices in order to maintain or raise their revenues in the face of falling order volumes. Only two of the EU's 20 leading clothing suppliers increased their deliveries in volume terms-namely India and the USA-but nine increased their value. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2010.",", Commerce; Economics; Sales; Textile industry; Textiles; Clothing imports; Clothing suppliers; Consumer spendings; Domestic sales; Double-digit rates; Export demand; Global economic crisis; Textile and clothings; demand; economic conditions; exports; imports; international trade; sales; textile-clothing industry; International trade",English,Article,323,11,Rural Resource Management

Although the impacts of tourism development on natural and social environment has been recognized, systematic studies of destination environment and its sustainable development in evaluation models, measure approaches, determinant factors, mechanism, integrative measures and management are still relatively rare. Researchers and policymakers pay much attention to the particular region, but give little consideration to that environmental impact of tourism development has the characteristics of interregional diffusion, spatial shift and worldwide influence of ecological liability. Therefore how to investigate the tourist environmental impact thoroughly and how to realize sustainable development from a broad perspective is a theoretical and empirical issue. This paper gives the definition of tourist wastes from the characters of tourism ecosystem cycle of substances and energy. Based on the abroad related literatures of tourism wastes studies published in recent years. It is found that the relative studies covered a wide range regarding their contents and study areas, including tourism waste of tourism exploitation, tourist and tourist corporation activities. But in China, the studies on the tourism wastes are still on the initial stage. The suitable management system for handling the tourism wastes has not been established in China.

Study areas were divided into four centres, typical of compact development or smart growth, and four linear, auto-oriented corridors. Results show substantial variation in the amount of walking across study areas. Trips are shorter and more likely to be via walking in centres. A key to the centres' increased walking travel is the concentration of local shopping and service destinations in a commercial core. Yet the amount of business concentration that is associated with highly pedestrian-oriented neighbourhoods is from three to four times as large as what can be supported by the local resident base, suggesting that pedestrian-oriented neighbourhoods necessarily import shopping trips, and hence driving trips, from larger surrounding catchment areas. The results suggest both land use and mobility strategies that can be appropriate for suburban regions. © 2011 Urban Studies Journal Limited.",", 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Housing; Humans; Los Angeles; Residence Characteristics; Social Behavior; Social Change; Socioeconomic Factors; Suburban Health; Suburban Population; Transportation; Walking; California; Canada; Los Angeles County; Manitoulin Island; Ontario [Canada]; South Bay; United States; land use planning; mobility; neighborhood; suburban area; urban development; urban growth; article; demography; economics; education; environmental protection; ethnology; exercise; health; history; housing; human; legal aspect; physiology; population; psychological aspect; social behavior; social change; socioeconomics; traffic and transport; United States; walking, Conservation of Natural Resources; Exercise; History",English,Article,160,3,Urban Sustainability

While trade and commerce are vital for the financial development of Canada, high volumes of heavy truck traffic introduce a considerable strain on urban traffic management. This phenomenon is very prominent in the Metro Vancouver area, which features numerous marine and rail intermodal terminals highly occupied with Asia-Pacific goods movement. Heavy truck traffic associated with the Asia Pacific Gateway is anticipated to increase significantly over the next 10 years. In order to better cope with this trend, TransLink, in collaboration with Transport Canada, the BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, and Port Metro Vancouver commissioned a study to improve the movement of Asia Pacific goods along the region's major road corridors through the inclusion of technology. The purpose of the study was to devise a strategy for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) implementation to improve the efficiency, safety and security of truck-related goods movement in the region by defining and planning the creation of ""Smart Corridors"". These ""Smart Corridors"" will facilitate the transportation of goods between various regional points of entry and major destinations (such as inter-modal yards and logistics centres) in the Metro Vancouver area, and serve to alleviate existing and future issues related to commercial goods movement, as well as its effect on general purpose traffic. The study included identification of candidate applications and technologies and the formation of a staged implementation schedule by considering prioritization of corridors and ITS technologies, focusing on the most urgent needs in the most troubled areas and corridors, while considering various organizational issues and the stakeholders affected.",", Climate change; Commercial vehicle operations; Intelligent systems; Trucks; Urban planning; Financial development; Heavy-truck traffic; Intelligent transportation systems; Intermodal terminals; Organizational issues; Safety and securities; Transportation of goods; Urban traffic management; Freight transportation",English,Conference paper,269,4,Mobility and Transportation

7005395057; 56186787100,Use of a hybrid algorithm for modeling coordinated feeder bus route network at suburban railway station,2009,"In the metropolitan cities of developed and developing countries, longer journeys are mostly performed by two or more modes. In the event of availability of suburban trains and public buses, commuters prefer to travel a longer stretch of their journeys by train, so as to avoid traffic congestion on roads, and the remaining part by buses to reach local areas if their final destination is not in close proximity to railway stations. Normally suburban trains have fixed corridors and buses have the flexibility to serve remote local areas. Thus design of feeder routes from railway stations to various destinations and the transfer time from trains to buses plays a very important role and can be controlled by transport planners. A considerable amount of research has been done on the independent design of a bus route network without considering the effect of train services. Researchers have made attempts using heuristics, simulation, expert systems, artificial intelligence, and optimization techniques for design of routes and schedules. So far, limited effort has been made in modeling coordinated operations. In this research, a new hybrid algorithm which exploits the benefits of genetic algorithms and a well tested heuristic algorithm for the study area is discussed. More convincing results in terms of feeder routes and coordinated schedules at the selected railway station are obtained by the proposed hybrid algorithm as compared to earlier approaches adopted by the writers for the same study area. © 2009 ASCE.","Administrative data processing; Artificial intelligence; Buses; Circuit theory; Computational methods; Decision support systems; Developing countries; Expert systems; Feeding; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Hybrid sensors; Locomotives; Metropolitan area networks; Optimization; Railroad cars; Railroad stations; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Traffic congestion; Transportation routes; accessibility; artificial intelligence; bus transport; commuting; developing world; genetic algorithm; optimization; railway transport; research work; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation mode; transportation planning; urban transport; Bus routes; Close proximities; Coordinated operations; Design of feeders; Feeder buses; Feeder routes; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid methods; Independent designs; Metropolitan cities; Optimization techniques; Railway stations; Study areas; Suburban trains; Suburbs; Train services; Transfer times; Transport planners; Routing algorithms, Algorithms; Hybrid methods; Optimization; Railroad station; Scheduling; Suburbs",English,Article,240,4,Mobility and Transportation
56581345600,An Improved model design for fare collection in local buses using RFID technology,2010,"Transportation is one of the most important public sectors in a country. With the increase of population, transport sector is getting a tough challenge to meet the public demand and satisfaction. To meet the increased expectation, local transport systems have been improved with the help of modern technology. For an easier and comfortable way of collecting fares based on the passenger's destination different technology have been used so far. Smart card reading techniques (like Oyster in United Kingdom) are well used in this case where cards store cash required for a journey. Though RFID technology is used in these techniques, there are still some problems with these systems. For example, in some cases a fixed amount of fare is deducted without considering the destination length the passenger is traveling. This is beneficial for someone moving far but might not be good enough for someone going to a near marketplace. In a short, public transit fare collection technique is still not developed at a satisfactory level even though other applications like toll fair collection, car parking authorization etc are well improved through successful deployment of RFID system. This study proposes an improved model based on RFID where passenger's starting and ending point of journey is considered and so it will be possible to deduct fares only for the distance travelled. The paper also describes detail implementation strategy and advantages of the system over others. © Common Ground, Tanzilur Rahman, All Rights Reserved.",", RFID; Smart card; Transportation",English,Conference paper,241,4,Mobility and Transportation

Despite positive growth indicators, rural tourism is criticized for several reasons, including issues with employment, ownership and lack of understanding of the industry. Although much has been written on the development of community-based tourism and its potential to address such concerns, much of the discussion remains at theoretical levels, with few examinations of practical frameworks for rural communities in crisis, such as the current experience in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. Enquiries into tourism's contribution to rural community economic development identified two gaps concerning how rural tourism can be a viable industry in resource-dependent communities and how to embed the industry within a community seeking alternatives from a deficit/crisis context. Interviews with a tourism operator in rural Manitoba, Canada seemed to provide an answer to both of these questions, through the application of Appreciative Inquiry (AI) to rural tourism development. Such an examination indicates that although such an approach does not solve the issues, it does provide a new lens through which to understand the potential for tourism in rural communities. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Appreciative inquiry; Economic development; Rural tourism development, Canada; North America; economic impact; employment; ownership; rural development; rural economy; tourism development",English,Article,212,11,Rural Resource Management

The focus of extant literature on sustainability has been more on the environmental and socio-cultural protection of the intrinsic qualities in the countryside, but less on the economic viability and marketing feasibility of rural tourism. The understanding of rural tourists has particularly been overlooked. This study examined the relationship between population migration at tourist origins and tourist arrivals from these origins to a rural destination. Through a conceptual application of gravity model, the study found that population migration exerted a significant effect on tourist arrivals. The study also revealed that the demographic variable of gender affected the dynamics of the relationship, suggesting that demographic information of migrants at tourist origins can offer richer marketing intelligence for rural destinations. The study's findings highlight the importance for rural communities to understand population migration at source markets, and provide a scientific tool to predict migration-induced tourist demand to rural destinations.

Zermatt is one of the few car-free tourist resorts in Switzerland. Access to the resort is only possible by public transport or by taxi. Transportation within the resort is done by small electric vehicles. The operation of these electric vehicles is regulated and only possible with a permission. Despite the fact that Zermatt is a car-free village, the resort has a traffic problem. More and more tourists feel disturbed by the frequent passages of the electric cars in the roads designed for pedestrians. Presently about 500 electric vehicles are permitted. The m unicipality of Zermatt tries to reduce the traffic problem with several measures, among them a road pricing scheme. The traffic shall be reduced by a toll for using the roads with electric vehicles. Depending on their main use, certain routes or time periods will be free of charge (e.g. hotel vehicles can collect arriving guests at the station for free). A road pricing system in Zermatt has a lot of peculiarities compared with other pricing systems. A public invitation to tender has been prepared and will be issued in spring 2009. The winning solution will be presented at the assembly at the municipal level in order to take a final decision by summer/autumn 2009.","Costs; Electric automobiles; Electric load management; Electric vehicles; Highway administration; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Roads and streets; Rural areas; Taxicabs; Traffic control; Transportation; Transportation charges; Vehicles; Invitation to tenders; Municipal levels; Public transport; Road pricing; Small electric vehicles; Switzerland; Traffic problems; Zermatt; Highway planning, Demand management; Road pricing; Switzerland; Zermatt",English,Conference paper,233,4,Mobility and Transportation

57224751535,A probabilistic estimation of the importance of AVLS in fleet management,2009,"The paper concerns the application of automatic vehicle location systems (AVLS) for the control and management of fleet of vehicles whose regular routes are random, i.e. with origins and destinations so numerous and variable that they cannot be predefined. Typical examples include road shipments, pick-up and delivery services and express couriers, demand responsive transport services and public utility services (gas, water, etc.). Specific reference is made to freight transport but analogous observations may be valid for passenger transport. The average response time of the mobile unit depends on: - the accuracy of the AVLS adopted; - the configuration of the fleet within the territory where it operates; - a number of operative parameters, among which are the size of the operative area, the number of vehicles employed, the average time that they are in use, their average speed, and the average time taken to perform the service. The results of two specific models provide average response times which can be compared in transport operations carried out with and without the use of an AVLS. If we abstract the equations derived from these, we obtain a quantity Δt, which measures the reduction in response time resulting from the adoption of an AVLS. Δt is a function of the operative parameters of the fleet, and the way it is used. The relevance of the results is related to the role of accuracy, integrity and continuity of the future Galileo system for transport location services.

Such impact is particularly salient for long-haul destinations. Recently tourism organisations such as the unwto have also expressed concern that aviation sector-focused mitigation policies in wealthy nations that are the major international tourism outbound markets will negatively affect tourism development and wealth transfers to tourism-dependent developing nations. This article reviews emerging climate policies in major tourism outbound markets that have direct implications for the aviation sector and examines the potential consequences for travel costs and tourism demand in 10 tourism-dependent less developed island states with diverse geographic and tourism market characteristics. The analysis confirms that aviation mitigation policies would affect tourism demand to these nations.

However, despite the potential of the technology, there are challenges that must be addressed. First, the need for protected, dedicated lanes that provide a manageable and extremely reliable environment for safe automated travel. Second, an AHS has to be designed so that it will be accepted by drivers and will be used effectively. Third, the complexities of automated driving systems will require vehicle and highway systems that operate at a higher level of reliability and performance than today, and with new management and operating systems to allow increased performance. Fourth, institutional challenges are likely to include increased liability for manufacturers and owner/operators of automated systems. Fifth, growth of traffic and the significantly different handling and operating characteristics of commercial motor vehicles present real challenges to accommodating commercial vehicle operations on an automated highway.

NoID,World Textile and Apparel Trade and Production Trends: USA and EU,2008,"US clothing demand contracted in 2008 for the first time since the late 1940s. Sales via clothing and clothing accessory stores, and department stores were down although sales via warehouse clubs and superstores were dynamic. Clothing sales are expected to decline further in 2009 as consumers cut back on their spending, and devote a larger share of their disposable income to savings. Clothing imports fell by 2.7% in volume terms, and the fall was evident in garments made from all of the major fibre types-cotton, wool, man-made fibres, and silk blends and non-cotton vegetable fibres (SBVF). Textile imports were down by 7.2%, reflecting declines in yarns, fabrics and made-up textiles. China remained the USA's largest textile and clothing supplier in 2008 with a 41% share of the market. Other major suppliers included Pakistan, India, Mexico and Vietnam. US production of textiles and clothing fell sharply, reflecting the weakening market as well as the continuing migration of production to lower-cost foreign locations. The fall in output also had a detrimental effect on employment. However, exports rose-by 1.1% in textiles and by 2.6% in clothing. EU textile and clothing production also declined in 2008, and the decline accelerated following falls in the second half of 2007. Clothing output in the third quarter of 2008 was down by 4.7% compared with the corresponding period a year earlier while textile output was down by an even sharper 8.7%. The drop in output came after the elimination of safeguard quotas against certain Chinese products at the end of 2007, and coincided with a worsening of the EU trade deficit in 2008. Having said that, imports from most of the major suppliers weakened in volume terms. During the first 11 months of 2008, textile and clothing imports from Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam all fell at double digit rates. The main exception was China, which raised its shipments to the EU by 6.5%. EU firms have been achieving gains in certain export markets. In Eastern Europe, for example, notable successes have included Russia-which became the largest destination for EU clothing exports in 2007-and Ukraine.

7006340213; 57019245100; 57198029525,Challenges of alpine catchment management under changing climatic and anthropogenic pressures,2008,"Water resources in mountain areas are particularly important with respect to new and increasing pressures in the headwater areas of catchments. Climate change has resulted in a decrease in precipitation and decrease in groundwater recharge in the western and southern Alps over the last few decades. This is coupled with changing anthropogenic pressures such as an increase in water abstraction for tourism and artificial snow in addition to the water demands of agriculture and hydroelectricity. Water consumption by tourism in winter is several times higher than that of the permanent population. To avoid the development of water shortages with relation to other users, a clear quantification of parameters within the water cycle is necessary. However, measurements of classical hydrological and biological components for model validation are often missing and terrestrial photogrammetry is not yet purposefully applied. An integrated hydrological model is applied to the ski resort of Les Arcs, Bourg-St-Maurice in Savoy, France, taking into account the impacts of artificial snow on torrent discharge under different climatological and anthropogenic scenarios with relation to interbasin water transfer. The classical arguments for the expansion of artificial snow are the necessity of winter tourism to maintain the local and regional economy but no empirical relation exists between snow production and ski frequentation. If the clear trend of increasing temperatures in the mountains continues, less and less reliable snowmaking days will be available and some regions may gradually turn into unprofitable zones depending on wind (e.g. foehn conditions), evaporation, aspect and altitude. New adaptation strategies for diversification of tourism in mountain areas, e.g. through a four seasons approach, have to be developed. Since mountain areas are highly fragile, powerful decision support systems are required to control hydrological modifications and prevent water conflicts. Scientists cooperating with stakeholders will be increasingly confronted with issues such as economical benefits versus environmental impacts. Even before the stage of developing decision support tools with the stakeholders concerned, important work is necessary to develop an interdisciplinary and intersectorial problem consciousness and acceptance. There is an urgent need for sub-scale catchment management plans that take into account local hydrological and economical requirements and conflicts that are linked to, but not overshadowed by large-scale catchment plans.","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Decision making; Decision support systems; Environmental impact; Groundwater; Information technology; Landforms; Recreational facilities; Regional planning; Runoff; Snow making; Water management; Water supply; Adaptation strategies; Alpine catchments; Anthropogenic pressures; Artificial snow; Biological components; Catchment management; Decision support tools; Economical benefits; Economy; Empirical relations; Ground water recharge; Head waters; Hydrological modelling; Hydrological models; Hydrological modifications; Inter-basin water transfer; Model validation; Regional economy; Tourism; Water abstraction; Water conflict; Water consumption; Water cycle; Water demand; Water shortages; Catchments, Artificial snow; Economy; Hydrological modelling; Tourism; Water management",English,Conference paper,364,11,Rural Resource Management

The aims of this paper are to analyze the behaviour of railway passengers using the smart card data, and to evaluate the effects of train operation policies. The analysis is focused on the before and after comparison of travel choice behaviour of passengers when the railway company changed the train timetable. The individual passengers passing times at the entrance and exit ticket gates of origin and destination stations were aggregated for a small discrete time interval in a day. Through analyzing the departure and arrival time distribution and the travel time distribution, it was found that the passengers smoothly adjusted their travel behaviour for the improved train timetable. When the passing times of ticket gates of both origin and destination stations are combined with the train timetable, it becomes possible to identify the train that each traveller was likely on board. Through the before and after comparison, it is shown how the railway passengers have changed their train choosing behaviour for the improved time schedules.","Locomotives; Railroad cars; Railroad transportation; Railroads; conference proceeding; public transport; railway transport; road pricing; transportation development; travel behavior; travel time; Passenger demand; Public transport; Smart card; Travel behaviour analysis; Travel time savings; Transportation, Passenger demand; Public transport; Smart card; Travel behaviour analysis; Travel time savings",English,Conference paper,234,4,Mobility and Transportation

Apart from US action in Grenada in 1983, the extra-regional response to these acts was minimal. However, in the aftermath of 9/11, the US has introduced a number of counter-terrorist measures into the region from Washington through such agencies as Southcom, the FBI, the DEA, and the Department of Homeland Security, now including the Coast Guard, to forestall future acts of terrorism. Also the UN, the OAS, and the CARICOM, at the instigation of the US, have encouraged Caribbean nations to adopt resolutions and pass anti-terrorist legislation at the local level in the fight against terrorism. US policy toward the region is based on its own self-interest since it considers the Caribbean its ""Third Border,"" one that is difficult to close to security threats. In all of this, the Caribbean nations welcome the security, more so because of the incidental protection it offers to their fragile tourist-dependent economies that are sensitive to political and other threats. This coincidence of interest has seen the US merge drug-trafficking and terrorism into one consolidated threat. Traditionally, the Caribbean region has not allocated a large part of its budget to security concerns, but with external assistance, particularly from the US, the region's police and military forces have been called upon to adapt to the global threats of the post-9/11 era by strengthening operational capacity, mission readiness, and intensify regional cooperation. This new thrust also includes making border tightening security measures more comprehensive and robust as well as the sharing of information, including intelligence.

Risk is measured in terms of capacity losses between an origin and a destination. An event tree determines the probabilities that the network's links are in particular states. The maximum flow between the OD pair, subtracted from the maximum flow of the baseline network, determines the consequences, or impact.

The group that was involved in the shooting was found to comprise 21 officers from military intelligence, four from the judicial investigation agency and one from the Caracas police. They were apparently looking for someone who had recently killed a police officer. © 2009 Mercedes S. Hinton and Tim Newburn, All rights reserved.",,English,Book chapter,215,3,Urban Sustainability
55937234300; 6701424595,Microeconomic determinants of the duration of stay of tourists,2007,"The classical demand theory overlooks the peculiarities of tourist services (Quandt, 1970; Rugg, 1973; Papatheodorou, 2001). An analysis of the tourism demand should recognize that this is a time-consuming activity. In this paper we discuss the discrete/continuous choice model proposed by Dubin and McFadden (1984) and Hanemann (1984) as an alternative way of analysing the tourism demand. Our model focuses on one of the main characteristics of a tourist trip, the length of stay. Although the evolution of the length of stay has critical implications for tourist destinations, particularly on the income generated3 but also on tourists' spatial distribution throughout a destination (Opperman, 1994) and destinations' seasonality (Alegre and Pou (2003), it has received little attention in literature.4 For that purpose, an empirical model is estimated using data from one of the Mediterranean's lead-ing sun and sand destinations, the Balearic Islands, applying Pollak's (1969, 1971) conditional demand function. Lancaster (1966) modified the classical demand theory, reformulating it as a theory of the demand for attributes. In his simpler version, Lancaster (1966, p.137) proposes a technology of consumption that relates attributes (from which consumers derive direct utility) with a group of goods. Lancaster's model of consumption (1966) has been applied to the demand for tourism by Rugg (1973), Morley (1992), Papatheodorou (2001), Seddighi and Theocharous (2002) and Huybers (2003 a), among others. These authors assume that the utility generated by some relevant characteristics of the trip increases with the time spent on holiday. In Rugg (1973) it is assumed that tourism generates a vector z, the elements of which are quantities of destinational characteristics. The values of this vector are dependent on the length of stay at different destinations, z = B t, where t is the vector of the lengths of stay and B is the matrix of coefficients that generates the quantities of characteristics z. This function describes the production of characteristics by commodities, that is, the days spent visiting each destination (Rugg, 1973). The above approach has several drawbacks. Firstly, no direct utility is derived from the length of stay, since it only affects the values of the consumed amounts of holiday characteristics. Following Gorman (1980), it can be assumed that the consumed amount of a good or service itself generates utility. This implies that the length of time a tourist spends on holiday contributes directly to his satisfaction with the trip and, by extension, that the length of stay should be treated as a holiday characteristic. Secondly, the empirical applications of the model should, on the one hand, explicitly define the technology of consumption (i.e. the coefficients of matrix B) and, on the other, justify the product characteristics dependent on the length of stay. None of the previous authors complies with these two requirements. The discrete choice or random utility model proposed by McFadden (1974) and Manski (1977) has also been applied to recreational or tourism demand.5 The model assumes that consumers compare the utility of alternative choices, selecting the one that maximises their utility. These choices can concern any of the trip's different characteristics. However, in literature on leisure and tourism demand where discrete choice models are used, only the discrete characteristics of the trip have been analysed.6 The aim of this study is to use the discrete/continuous model of consumer demand proposed by Dubin and McFadden (1984) and Hanemann (1984) for modelling tourism consumption. These authors present a consumer choice model from which demand functions for the discrete or continuous characteristics of a good or service can be derived. Dubin and McFadden (1984) apply the discrete/continuous model to the household demand for energy. They suggest that domestic appliances are chosen according to their characteristics and the amount and type of energy that they consume. Households must weigh up the benefits that each appliance offers against expectations of future use and future energy prices. A similar approach can be taken to the demand for a length of stay at a holiday destination. Consumers weigh up the benefits of different holiday choices, bearing in mind the cost of each one and the length of stay they can afford, given their budget and time constraints. The model integrates the concept of Pollak's conditional demand function (1969, 1971), according to which consumers assign optimal quantities of some goods, dependent on another part of their consumption having already been determined. One advantage of this function is the fact that the conditioning goods need not be explicitly modelled. Moreover, the demand system will be correctly specified, whether the conditioning goods are chosen optimally or not (Browning and Meghir, 1991). In the case of the demand for length of stay, the tourist is assumed to choose the optimal length of stay, conditioned on the remaining holiday characteristics he has chosen (i.e. the destination, type of accommodation etc). The model for the length of stay is applied to tourists visiting the Balearic Islands, one of the Mediterranean's leading sun and sand destinations. 7 The data was drawn from the Tourist Expenditure Survey (TES) conducted by the Regional Government of the Balearic Islands in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands. The TES provides information about the tourists' sociodemographic profile as well as holiday characteristics, including the length of stay. According to the TES, the average length of stay fell by just over three days between 1989 and 2003 (from 13.14 to 9.89 days), representing a cumulative average fall of 2% per year. This trend is common to most European holiday destinations as well as to the main issuing countries (Tourism Intelligence International, 2000 a and 2000 b). Figure 1 shows the percentage of British and German tourists who visited the Balearic Islands on a holiday of up to a week, from 8 to 14 days and for over two weeks. It clearly highlights the importance of the downward trend in the Balearic Islands. Whilst in 1989, 17.1% of tourists spent up to a week in the Balearics, 74.6% spent between eight and fourteen days and 8.3% spent over two weeks, in 2003 the respective percentages were 47.6%, 46.5% and 5.8%. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the discrete/continuous choice model applied to the tourism demand and proposes a conditional demand function for the length of stay. Section 3 discusses the econometric specification and the data used. The results of the empirical model are outlined in Sect. 4. Finally, Sect. 5 contains the main conclusions.",,English,Book chapter,1067,4,Mobility and Transportation

It has an abundant domestic cotton supply, and cotton items account for about three-quarters of its apparel exports. Indeed, 13 of the 14 major clothing types exported from India to the EU are cotton products. The industry is characterised by a huge number of small-scale enterprises with the ability to take on small customised orders, and the flexibility to respond to quick changes. This structure stems from past government policies aimed at enhancing economic welfare and increasing employment. With these objectives in mind, the Indian government reserved many products - including woven and knitted apparel products - for exclusive production by small-scale units. However, the policy has now been phased out and, encouraged by the elimination of the global quota system at the end of 2004, the number of big players is growing. The EU and the USA are the biggest destinations for Indian apparel exports, between them taking 70%. The UAE has an 8% share but it is thought that most UAE imports are re-exported.

In this article, I discuss the complex and often ambiguous relationship between the clown's traditional sacred power and his forays into southern Thailand's political and economic landscape. By so doing, I focus my attention on the clown as being both a subversive and conservative agent. On the one hand, he represents a Tumerian-like anti-structure, which allows him to test the limits of social and political acceptability and on which his ritual personality as a sacred being rests.

7004524674,Culture on the ground: The world perceived through the feet,2004,"Classical accounts of human evolution posit a progressive differentiation between the hands as instruments of rational intelligence and feet as integral to the mechanics of bipedal locomotion. Yet evolutionists were modelling pedestrian performance on the striding gait of boot-clad Europeans. The bias of head over heels in their accounts follows a long-standing tendency, in western thought and science, to elevate the plane of social and cultural life over the ground of nature. This tendency was already established among European elites in the practice of destination-oriented travel, the use of shoes and chairs, and the valorization of upright posture. It was further reinforced in urban societies through paving the streets. The groundlessness of metropolitan life remains embedded not only in western social structures but also in the disciplines of anthropology, psychology and biology. A more grounded approach to human movement, sensitive to embodied skills of footwork, opens up new terrain in the study of environmental perception, the history of technology, landscape formation and human anatomical evolution.

NoID,"Contested terrain: Tourism, environment and security in Algeria's extreme south",2003,"Tourism has for a long time been an integral part of the nomadic economy and the Tuareg's domain, and is seen by them as providing them with their rightful place in the world economy. However, the way in which tourism has developed in the Sahara in recent years has brought the Central Sahara, in the opinion of many Tuareg, to the brink of what they see as an environmental catastrophe. This article examines the struggle over the last four years between a small, but rapidly growing, number of 'enlightened' Tuareg who are battling for an alternative, environmentally sustainable form of tourism and the short-term financial and political interests of mass tourism, unregulated tourisme sauvage and professional looters. However, during the course of these four years, another struggle has been waged by the forces of the state, smugglers and bandits of various kinds and, if some of the intelligence services are to be believed, al-Qaeda itself, for sheer physical control over this vast terrain. During the course of 2003, through the strange coincidence of a number of events, these two levels of struggle have been fused. The result is the possible development of a new politic, emerging from the fact that local people, notably the Tuareg, now realise that their governments have not only been inept in both safeguarding their regions' cultural and natural heritage and developing an environmentally sustainable tourism industry, but also that they can no longer ensure the region's security.",", Africa; Algeria; North Africa; regional security; terrorism; tourism development; tourism management",English,Article,242,3,Urban Sustainability

An evaluation of the sophistication of attraction planning showed a bipolar distribution. Attraction managers favored a planning horizon of three or five years, and were inclined to involve their employees in the planning process.

The ultimate goal of WFD is to achieve a good ecological status/potential of all water bodies before 2015. Together with the implementation of WFD also principles of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) are to be applied and national expansions of Natura 2000 networks are in progress. There are many elements which are important in river basin planning systems. In the Baltic Sea region for example, the pressures posed by economic activities including increasing tourism and port activities have to be considered in land and river basin planning. These matters are dealt with in the context of the Watersketch project, a scheme supported by the Interreg IIIB programme of the European Union. The project aims at producing an extensive planning system and a working scheme that accounts for the various, complex and opposing tasks currently subjected to water usage. The main goal is to produce and describe processes, that aid planning and decision making also in areas with limited resources to meet the diverse requirements concerning water. In addition, the project intends to: 1) analyse and synthesize the different directives and conventions focused on use of water courses. 2) demonstrate the major alternatives of river basin planning with a wide set of case studies ranging from southern tip of Baltic Sea (Poland) to northernmost corner of it (Norway). 3) provide a Water Planning Decision Support System for spatial planners, which takes into account all main components needed for economically, socially and ecologically sustainable use of water courses. Raise capacity to promote the sustainable development in river basins by means of an information exchange platform, training workshops and the dissemination of the information needed for sustainable use of river basins by means of a handbook. By a combined approach where planning is complemented by training and information exchange, this project will provide a long-term contribution towards addressing the problem, at the same time that it links itself with other similar projects, achieving synergy and avoiding duplications.","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Curricula; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Environmental regulations; Information dissemination; Networks (circuits); Planning; Regional planning; Rivers; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Capacity building; Eu-water framework directives; Good ecological status; Information exchanges; Integrated coastal zone management; Natura 2000 networks; River basin management; River basin planning; Sustainable development, Capacity building; Network; River basin management; Sustainable development",English,Conference paper,359,11,Rural Resource Management

Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis is a commonly used tool for analysing both the internal and external environments in order to attain a systematic approach and support for a decision situation. In this study, we show how some weaknesses of SWOT analysis can be avoided and how it can be elaborated upon in order to provide more comprehensive decision support. The approach is applied to the question of does local culture have the potential to be a success factor in rural tourism in two case areas, namely in the regions of Ylä-Savo in Finland and Kassel in Germany. The research was based on expert interviews, which were structured according to the principles of value-focused thinking and A'WOT analysis. A'WOT is a hybrid method combining the well-known SWOT analysis and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In this study, SMART techniques are applied in an A'WOT framework instead of the AHP. The objectives and the operating environment, i.e. the two major elements in any strategic management, were covered in the analysis. The results showed that local culture has the potential to be a success factor in rural tourism, in other forms of rural entrepreneurship, and also in the case study regions. Investments which enhance and strengthen local culture are recommended over those that utilise culture and traditions to make products in tourism business. Strengthening local culture opens up possibilities for future innovations and sustainable development. A strong culture and an awareness of one's own traditions form a natural foundation for innovations. Value-focused thinking used as a methodology to define the values and objectives along with A'WOT for strategic planning, provide good means of enhancing sustainable innovations. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

55967274500,A sustainable transport structure as a problem of choosing intelligent indicators,2005,"The current approaches to city and regional planning state that there is a need to accelerate travel speed between functions at a local level, as well as within regions, or even continents, to gain advantages from free competition. This assumption, however, leads to a separation of functions and the spreading of settlements followed by considerable negative effects on ecological and social aspects. The raising of speed in the transport system therefore should be more sophisticated, since at the local level accessibility is the main indicator to describe mobility. Mobility is defined by the number of trips per day, independent of the modes of transport used, i.e. also walking. Defined in this way, mobility is rather a constant because of limited purposes of trips. However, there are two possibilities to reach a ""mobile"" society. On the one hand we can attempt to increase velocity to reach destinations even far away (which is not sustainable because the short term effects of reducing travel time are compensated by a lot of feedbacks within short periods as well as long term changes of settlement patterns). The alternative approach is to keep the destinations of necessary trips to a short distance, and only by that, can the operation possibilities of alternative modes of transport be optimized. Within a complex system, built by a lot of feed back loops, the human ability to perceive such system effects is overstrained. Therefore it is useful to orientate on proved ecological principles. In analysing complex systems, we have to bear in mind that human beings are preconditioned to assess directly effective local factors which are consciously perceived by the individual (e.g. time savings, noise, safety) as rather high. On the other hand, indirect effective indicators (such as energy, flora and fauna, waste of space) which are perceived unconsciously are rated very low. The effect of this weighting problem can be demonstrated on simulations of assessment procedures. © 2005 WIT Press.","Ecology; Large scale systems; Regional planning; Social aspects; Traffic control; Urban transportation; Assessment procedure; Ecological principles; Human abilities; Key-indicators; Multi Criteria Analysis; Settlement patterns; Short-term effects; Sustainable transport; Assessment procedure; Ecological principles; Human abilities; Key-indicators; Multi Criteria Analysis; Settlement patterns; Short-term effects; Sustainable transport; Sustainable development, Human ability of perception; Key-indicators; MCA- multi criteria analysis; Mobility constants; Sustainability",English,Conference paper,321,11,Rural Resource Management

This article presents the findings of a research project that aimed at unveiling the travel motivational characteristics of the healthy-living market segment along with its socio-demographic characteristics. In today's competitive environment, it has become a must to learn about a specific segment's characteristics. Destinations as well as tourism/hospitality organizations cannot afford to waste their resources on decisions taken based on personal opinions and not hard intelligence on specific markets of interest. Using the findings as guidelines, recommendations are presented on possible public and private sectors' roles in supporting the development and marketing of hospitality and tourism products and services positioned to cater to vacationers who have a healthy-living oriented lifestyle. © SAGE Publications.",", healthy-living; lifestyle; pull factors; push factors; segmentation; tourist behavior; travel motives",English,Article,237,3,Urban Sustainability
57214413265,Not without purpose,2006,"Study after study finds that workers get 80 percent of their job know-how informally. The choice is whether they do it well or do it poorly. Important as it is, informal learning doesn't show up on the corporate radar because it isn't recorded in industrial age charts of account. No one has a budget for it, but organizations that fail to leverage informal learning leave buckets of money on the table. Informal learning is effective because it is personal. The individual calls the shots. The learner is responsible. It is the only thing that will work with the digital natives now entering the workforce. Formal learning is like riding a bus: the driver decides where the bus is going, while the passengers are along for the ride. On the opposite end, informal learning is like riding a bike: The rider chooses the destination, the speed, and the route. The rider can take a detour at a moment's notice to admire the scenery or use the bathroom. Informal learning is natural. It occurs when we treat people and organizations as organisms in nature. Thinking is a skill. You get better at it with practice. People confuse thinking with intelligence. That is a mistake because it leads intelligent people to squander their potential by not learning to think.",,English,Article,216,4,Mobility and Transportation
7006575734,Al Qaeda after the Iraq conflict,2005,"The May 12, 2003, suicide bombings of three Western housing compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia reopened questions about the strength and viability of Al Qaeda in the post-Iraq conflict environment. The apprehension of a number of senior Al Qaeda leaders in recent months, combined with the absence of major terrorist attacks during the military campaign in Iraq, had led some to believe that Al Qaeda was severely crippled and unable to launch major attacks. Others argued that the organization was in transition to a more decentralized structure, had gained new recruits, and might even be a growing threat. This report analyzes current viewpoints about the state of Al Qaeda and the threat it poses to the United States. It will be updated as events warrant. The May 12, 2003, bombings of three Western housing compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia marked an apparent evolution in the behavior of Al Qaeda that some experts believe provides insight into the viability of the organization after the U.S. military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although there has been important, measurable progress in the United States' efforts against Al Qaeda since September 11th, experts disagree as to whether the organization as a whole presents a greater or lesser threat to the United States and its interests today. At the heart of the analysis is the question of whether Al Qaeda can launch additional major attacks of strategic impact or whether the organization is now largely relegated to low level tactical attacks. In the wake of the Riyadh bombings, this report examines the debate about how to assess Al Qaeda's strength and will explain the major points on which experts differ, as well as the assumptions underlying their arguments. The attack in Saudi Arabia was not the first recent incident to display suspected links to Al Qaeda. Beginning in 2002, Al Qaeda reportedly either contributed to or participated directly in a number of wide-ranging attacks, including against a passenger plane and hotel in Kenya (in which 15 were killed and 40 injured), a night club in Indonesia (where about 180 were killed), a French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen (in which one crewman was killed and four injured), and a synagogue in Tunisia (where 19 were killed and 22 injured).1 A number of other potential Al Qaeda operations were successfully disrupted.2 The organization is still considered dangerous, and the Bush Administration has been warning of the likelihood of additional terrorist attacks for many months.3 But the absence of major terrorist incidents during the Iraq war had led to a degree of optimism even among those who believed that Al Qaeda's terrorism had not ended. Osama bin Laden, in an audiotape released April 7, 2003, urged his followers to mount suicide attacks ""to avenge the innocent children...assassinated in Iraq."" On some previous occasions, such public declarations had been followed by major events. When those attacks did not occur after bin Laden's April statement, their absence was seen as a possible indicator of the organization's weakness. Although intelligence officials cautioned that Al Qaeda was still capable of mounting significant attacks, there was a sense that U.S. counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda had severely damaged the organization. Cofer Black, head of the State Department's counterterrorism office, was quoted in early May 2003 saying, ""This was the big game for them - you put up or shut up and they have failed. It proves that the global war on terrorism has been effective, focused and has got these guys on the run.""4 The attacks in Saudi Arabia, as well as subsequent explosions in Morocco, seem to have tempered that optimism, not just because they occurred (U.S. officials had consistently argued that future attacks were inevitable and had even warned of a heightened security threat to Saudi Arabia) but because the Riyadh bombings in particular displayed specific characteristics that worried terrorism experts. Before then, the selection of targets since 9/11 seemed to indicate that the U.S. assault on Al Qaeda had forced it to shift to opportunistic ""soft"" targets, especially tourist destinations in areas of the world that were relatively unfortified against terrorist attacks. The Riyadh attacks were more sophisticated. The perpetrators reportedly used high quality explosives, engaged in multiple coordinated attacks, carried out long-term reconnaissance, and attacked well-fortified targets.5 They also used large suicide assault teams to kill the guards and breach the existing fortifications, a seeming tactical innovation.6 These characteristics, potentially reflective of enduring, advanced operational capability, caused some experts to reassess their understanding of how Al Qaeda is evolving as an organization in the post-Iraq conflict environment. © 2006 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The current UBC transit loop has been in place for 20 years and, despite several expansions, is at capacity for both vehicles and passengers. In order to meet future service demands, the physical dimensions of the facility would have to be expanded to three times the existing size. Such an expansion is not desirable due to both environmental considerations and UBC's own overall development vision in which a below-grade transit facility is proposed. The resultant constrained terminal footprint proposes a number of operational challenges for both bus and passenger movements. The success of the proposed transit terminal is dependent on not just one terminal subsystem, nor the sum of those subsystems, but the integration of all subsystems using ITS components.",", Intelligent systems; Traffic control; Transportation; Environmental considerations; Operational challenges; Passenger movements; Physical dimensions; Real time; Service demand; Terminal management; University of British Columbia; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",English,Conference paper,140,4,Mobility and Transportation

57189695461,Sustainable management of rivers in malaysia: Involving all stakeholders,2005,"All over the world, including Malaysia, management of rivers is a central issue in this 21st Century. While government has always been traditionally entrusted with the responsibility of managing rivers, increasingly, the public, NGOs (Non‐Governmental Organisations), industrialists, farmers, and other stakeholders are playing a greater role. Sustainable management of rivers involves cooperation between countries and states sharing the same river basin, and cooperation between government and all stakeholders. Internationally, countries need to negotiate and use rivers as the basis for peace rather than conflict. In Malaysia, the Federal Government can initiate policies and remain in charge of governance of rivers, in consultation and cooperation with state governments. However, government must relinquish some of its responsibility on river management to all other stakeholders, viz. industrialists, entrepreneurs, farmers, communities/squatters, NGOs, educational institutions, fishermen, conservationists, tourists, the general public, etc. All stakeholders need to start taking proactive actions, even sacrifices, to manage, protect, conserve and restore our rivers so that their resources can be sustained for future use. This is where people from all levels ranging from politicians, policy makers, private companies, NGOs to individuals can play crucial roles. River management and related river issues need to involve NGOs and the people as these issues happen at the local level. Decision‐making regarding solutions should be carried out at the lowest appropriate level, ideally involving all stakeholders ranging from government to the private sector, NGOs, the local community and schools. People should be the focus both in decision making as well as active “workers” involved with restoration work. The motto of “Malaysia Boleh” (Malaysia Can) involves all Malaysians.This paper discusses how all stakeholders can contribute by working together in smart-partnerships with government towards effective and sustainable management of rivers in Malaysia. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",", Drought and flood management; Environmental conservation; Government-industry-NGO partnerships; Non-governmental organisations; Political-economy of rivers; Public participation; Sustainable river management",English,Article,294,3,Urban Sustainability

56112769100; 56112366700,ITS deployment and improvements in smaller cities: Minnesota case studies,2004,"Minnesota is widely known for not only its great lakes, but also for its metropolitan area including the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. With combined populations of more than 2 million residents, much focus is given to the rising congestion in these areas and transportation management. Yet there is another significant transportation story in Minnesota - that of the needs of the rural areas and smaller urban areas. Minnesota has a great deal of weather-related traffic issues, special events throughout the state, seasonal tourism, and challenges affecting roadways without traditional communications or power infrastructure. Minnesota has addressed these issues through a concept known as Transportation Operations and Communications Centers, or TOCCs, using co-location of state patrol and DOT personnel and a variety of technologies to manage traffic outside of the major metropolitan area of the Twin Cities. There are currently 9 TOCCs located in smaller Minnesotan cities. Five of these TOCCs have been upgraded to include a variety of cost-effective intelligent transportation system technologies which facilitate traffic challenges. The TOCCs also complement the Twin Cities Regional Transportation Operations Center (RTMC), which includes several workstations accessing TOCC and related transportation information from the corresponding cities. This paper will focus on several of these cities and surrounding rural areas including Duluth, St. Cloud, and Rochester Minnesota. It will look at the transportation tools used to effectively manage unique challenges. This paper will also discuss the foundational public-private partnership model, recent operations and system enhancements, related ITS planning for additional implementations, linkage with the Twin Cities transportation operations, and lessons learned.",", Highway planning; Intelligent systems; Rural areas; Taxicabs; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Urban planning; Intelligent transportation systems; Metropolitan area; Power infrastructures; Public private partnerships; Regional transportation; System enhancement; Transportation management; Transportation operations; Transportation personnel",English,Conference paper,259,4,Mobility and Transportation

7004946824,Jockeying for position: What it means and why it matters to regional development policy when places compete,2004,"The realization that places compete for investment has expanded in recent years to encompass competition among places for the attention of migrants, tourists and media glow as well as investment. The most competitive places have been multidimensional in their attractions and have made the transition to the knowledge-based economy. The latest priority is being placed on attracting mobile workers and mobile investment. Creative workers are the core of the knowledge economy and of its geographies such as 'intelligent places' and 'learning regions'. Knowledge metrics, innovation indices and report cards are increasingly common, each seemingly developed to sort the list of places in a different order. Lists or league tables of 'the best places' for business, to live, retire and visit are key features of economies and societies whose factors of success are highly mobile. Competition in a geographical context and entrepreneurial responses are unlikely to go away, reinforced by an industry comprised of consultancies, the trade press, formal education and other means of learning. Consequently, policy-makers need to grasp the nature of place competition and the critical roles of knowledge and of networks in the strategies of the most competitive places. The standard of competition is complex, comprising innovation indices and cooperation within the network of world cities. © 2004 Regional Studies Association.","Competition; Knowledge; Policy; Regional development; World cities, competitiveness; economic policy; knowledge; regional development",English,Review,213,11,Rural Resource Management
6507785037,Creating and implementing a model for sustainable development in tourism enterprises,2005,"The quest for sustainable tourism presents a challenge to integrate economic, social and environmental issues in tourism planning and - in order to implement this - to change attitudes and traditions among the different stakeholders within tourism. This calls for involvement of the different stakeholders in the change processes towards sustainable tourism and, accordingly, the creation of new patterns of interaction and collaboration between the stakeholders. This paper analyses how a project on sustainable tourism development in Mid- and North Jutland, Denmark, has engaged 26 small and medium sized tourism enterprises in an incremental change process towards sustainable tourism. Using the theory of collaboration, the paper analyses the process of identifying the common interests, defining the problems, setting the directions, and developing and starting the implementation of a four-step model for sustainable development in tourism enterprises. The question addressed is how to create a change process in the enterprises that is at the same time realistic and innovative. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, while the economic function of such sites consists in producing wealth for the entrepreneurs proposing multiple services to the tourists present on the sites, it seems simplistic to consider a tourist destination as being no more than a simple aggregation of actors. The existence of ties with the territory that can be qualified locally points to the presence of a cultural process that plays an important role in the creation of resources that are essential to the efficient operation of such a system. Drawing on several examples of sports and tourist sites in the French Alps, we show how this localised cultural system is built up and how it takes shape. The study of the forms of development set up by the different service providers and of the sports culture of the tourists provides valuable insights into the make-up and practical organisation of these cultural resources in an outdoor recreational site.","Alps; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World; cultural influence; mountain region; outdoor recreation; tourist destination, Localised cultural system; Outdoor sports resort; System of cultural intelligence; Territory",English,Article,185,3,Urban Sustainability
7006565100; 23968008700,World capacities and shipments of textile machinery,2004,"2003 was a year of mixed fortunes for the international textile machinery market. Deliveries of short staple spindles and shuttle looms grew strongly but there were declines in shipments of other types of spinning and weaving machinery. The market for weaving machinery in 200 3 was influenced largely by China. Global shipments of shuttleless looms dropped by 12% as China cut its purchases back by over 13%. However, China remained the leading destination with 71% of the world total, and strong growth was recorded in shipments to Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Malaysia, Turkmenistan and Turkey. Leading buyers in terms of numbers of looms included China, India, Italy, Pakistan and Turkey. Chinese mills also bought 107% more of the technologically less advanced shuttle looms in 2003, which contributed almost entirely to a 51% increase in global shipments. In the spinning sector, purchases of short staple spindles were the only type to record an increase, at 129%, following two years of decline. Acquisitions of long staple spindles fell by 32%. Purchases of open end rotors - which are based on a newer technology - also declined, but by a more modest 4.7%. Fast growing markets for short staple spindles included China, Peru, Portugal, South Africa and Spain. China increased its purchases of short staple spindles by a massive 550% and took 61% of global shipments. Other leading buyers, but some distance behind, were Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Turkey.
